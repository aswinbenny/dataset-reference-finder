Ignacio Casal ID1 1 Department of Molecular Biomedicine Centro de Investigaciones Biolo gicas Margarita Salas Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı ficas Madrid Spain 2 Protein Alternatives SL Tres Cantos Madrid Spain 3 European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute EMBL-EBI Wellcome Genome Campus Hinxton Cambridge United Kingdom juan ebi.ac.uk JAV icasal cib.csic.es JIC Abstract The cancer biomarker field has been an object of thorough investigation in the last decades. Despite this colorectal cancer CRC heterogeneity makes it challenging to identify and vali- date effective prognostic biomarkers for patient classification according to outcome and treatment response. Although a massive amount of proteomics data has been deposited in public data repositories this rich source of information is vastly underused. Here we attempted to reuse public proteomics datasets with two main objectives i to generate hypotheses detection of biomarkers for their posterior/downstream validation and ii to validate using an orthogonal approach a previously described biomarker panel. Twelve CRC public proteomics datasets mostly from the PRIDE database were re-analysed and integrated to create a landscape of protein expression. Samples from both solid and liquid biopsies were included in the reanalysis. Integrating this data with survival annotation data we have validated in silico a six-gene signature for CRC classification at the protein level and identified five new blood-detectable biomarkers CD14 PPIA MRC2 PRDX1 and TXNDC5 associated with CRC prognosis. The prognostic value of these blood-derived pro- teins was confirmed using additional public datasets supporting their potential clinical value. As a conclusion this proof-of-the-concept study demonstrates the value of re-using public proteomics datasets as the basis to create a useful resource for biomarker discovery and validation. The protein expression data has been made available in the public resource Expression Atlas. Author summary The need for new prognostic biomarkers is one of the main topics of interest in CRC Colorectal Cancer . A potential strategy to address this issue which to the best of our knowledge has not been attempted so far is the combination of different public proteomic studies generated from independent patient cohorts. Despite the abundance of available proteomics data meta-analyses have only been conducted at the genomic and PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 1 / 24 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation Robles J Prakash A Vizcaı no JA Casal JI 2024 Integrated meta-analysis of colorectal cancer public proteomic datasets for biomarker discovery and validation.

In this study we reanalyzed 12 mass spectrometry-based pub- lic proteomics datasets. In total the combined dataset included 440 samples from 299 dif- ferent patients encompassing both solid and liquid biopsies. Consequently we defined a proteomics landscape suitable for assessing protein expression in tumors and normal mucosa its association with patient outcome and its potential detection in liquid biopsies. Furthermore as a proof-of-concept for the data reuse strategy we demonstrated its capac- ity to validate an experimentally-based SEC6 gene signature at the protein level and to identify new blood-detectable biomarkers. The data generated in this study can be accessed by anyone since all the data have been made available in the Expression Atlas resource. Introduction Colorectal cancer CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide accounting for approxi- mately 10 of all diagnosed cancers 1 . Notably the most developed countries present the highest rates of incidence 2 . Regarding global mortality CRC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 3 . CRC is considered a highly heterogeneous disease 4 caused through various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms including microsatellite instability or mutations in oncogenes such as APC TP53 KRAS and BRAF. The molecular heterogeneity leads to variability in the pathogenesis outcome and treatment response 5 . Both clinical and molecular heterogeneity are essential challenges when facing CRC diagnosis and prognosis 6 and to face this heterogeneity several molecular classifications have been proposed 7 . CRC diagnostic procedures have made significant advances in the last years based on the massive use of faecal occult blood screening tests liquid biopsies and the more invasive colonoscopy 8 . However once the disease is detected the current clinical stratification systems based on the pathological staging presents some limitations that fail to identify a relevant number of patients relapsing and/or developing metastases after surgical resection. For those reasons it is especially crucial to identify prognostic biomarkers to categorize patients in stage II and III to prevent recurrence and to identify those patients who should receive more intensive treat- ments 9 . Although most of the approaches designed to address CRC diagnosis and prognosis have relied so far in samples from solid biopsies 4 10 obtained using highly invasive proce- dures biomarkers detectable in liquid biopsies are a preferable option for predicting and mon- itoring patient outcome and response to chemotherapy 11 . Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of secreted proteins on tumor progression and metastasis devel- opment 12 . In summary despite significant progress in CRC screening and diagnosis has been achieved 13 the problem of CRC prognosis and classification remains unresolved. Most of the available high-throughput omics data coming from cancer patients are based on DNA and RNA sequencing information. This applies to both solid and liquid biopsies. Indeed most of the attempts to classify CRC are based on transcriptomics data 4 10 . Never- theless proteins are most often the functional molecules that undertake the translation from genotype into the phenotype. In addition protein-based techniques such as ELISA or immu- nohistochemistry have demonstrated to be useful tools with clinical relevance 14 . Mass spec- trometry MS is the main high-throughput proteomics approach for providing quantitative measurements of protein abundance/expression 15 . Although publicly available genomics and transcriptomics datasets are more in number and scope large relevant proteomics studies such as those performed by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium CPTAC 16 or other independent teams have obtained MS-based protein expression information in PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 2 / 24 replaced by the PRIDE dataset identifier shown in the Table 1.

Taken together this protein expression data from different datasets can be con- sidered as a robust source of information for biomarker discovery and confirmation. Multiple proteomics datasets are freely available in public repositories. The PRIDE database as the most popular resource in this context 17 together with other open repositories e.g. CPTAC portal 16 j POST 18 contain thousands of proteomics datasets. Public data in these resources coming from different sources can be reanalysed and integrated to obtain a global view and potentially discover new insights. Integrative meta-analyses have already dem- onstrated to be useful using genomics and transcriptomics data 19 20 . Regarding proteomics quantitative reanalysis and integration of public data is emerging as a potent resource with multiple applications 21-25 . To our knowledge no previous studies have addressed prognos- tic biomarker identification in CRC from this perspective of reusing public proteomics data- sets. In the present study we selected reused and integrated 12 public proteomics datasets containing samples from both solid and liquid biopsies of CRC patients. The reanalysed and processed data have been deposited in the Expression Atlas resource 26 to facilitate protein abundance data access and visualisation. In summary we provide a CRC proteomic landscape with the capacity to validate previously reported prognostic biomarkers and to discover new sets of biomarkers demonstrating the potential and value of reusing public proteomics data- sets for biomarker discovery. Results Colorectal cancer proteomics datasets and integrative analysis We queried PRIDE 17 j POST 18 and the CPTAC 16 portal for CRC studies and selected 12 publicly available datasets for reanalysis Table 1 . These CRC datasets were divided in two groups corresponding to secreted and solid tumor samples respectively. The secretome group consisted of samples derived from blood cell culture extracellular vesicles exosomes and interstitial fluid whereas the solid tumor sample group consisted of samples derived from mucosa adenoma pre-malignant cellular masses and tumor tissues. The secretome and solid tumor sample groups consisted of 7 and 5 datasets respectively and included paired healthy and cancer samples. The characteristics of the overall patient cohorts included in the datasets are shown in Table 2. Patient composition of the meta-analysis shows a non-biased proportional distribution of the different sub-classifications of CRC according to mutations chromosomal stability age and sex. We reanalysed each sample group separately by creating two batches solid and secreted samples . Each batch consisted of all MS runs from all datasets that were part of a sample group. Protein identification and quantification analysis was performed using Max Quant 27 version 2.1.0.0 on a high-performance computing Linux cluster. In total the datasets con- tained 2 458 MS runs covering 440 samples from 299 individuals. The number of protein groups peptides and unique peptides identified in the two batches of samples are shown in Table 1. The protein abundances calculated from individual datasets are available to view and download from Expression Atlas 28 along with their experimental parameters sample meta- data and summary of sample quality assessment after post-processing. The data reanalysis pro- tocol is summarised in Fig 1 and explained in detail in S1 Fig. Protein abundance comparison in solid tumors and secreted samples Protein abundances were calculated for the secretome and solid tumor samples using the intensity-based absolute quantification i BAQ method and normalised by the FOT Fraction of Total method see Methods .

We identified similar numbers of canonical proteins across samples from colon mucosa colon adenoma which are pre-cancerous cell masses and colorectal tumor samples Fig 2A . The dynamic range of protein abundances was similar across tissue samples Fig 2B . Across datasets PXD001676 had the lowest number 29.1 of identified canonical proteins Fig 2C . However dataset PXD001676 showed a higher median protein abundance relative to the other datasets Fig 2D probably due to the fewer number of canonical proteins identified in this dataset. We found that the large majority of canonical pro- teins was simultaneously present in the three types of samples mucosa adenoma and tumor Fig 2E . Compared to the secreted samples the correlation of protein abundance among tumor tissues was relatively low S2 Fig . The highest correlation was observed in adenoma samples median R2 0.58 and the lowest correlation was among mucosa samples median R2 0.49 . Protein identification in secreted samples We obtained 5 861 protein groups from the secreted samples which were mapped to 5 091 parent genes canonical proteins . We identified a large number of proteins in samples from interstitial fluid 87.5 and extracellular vesicles and exosomes 74.2 while comparatively less proteins were identified in blood-derived 37.2 and cell culture samples 39.4 Fig 3A . The dynamic range of protein abundances across secreted samples and datasets is shown Fig 3B and 3D . Among datasets the largest numbers of canonical proteins were identified in datasets PXD005709 JPST000867 and PXD005693 Fig 3C . The median protein abundance was highest in cell culture-derived samples compared to other samples and similarly dataset PXD020454 had a higher median protein abundance likely due to the low number of canoni- cal proteins identified in this dataset.

Indeed the majority of canonical proteins were exclusively present in either two or three of the subgroups Fig 3E . We used the binned protein abundances to com- pare the correlation of protein abundances across secreted samples. We also observed a good correlation and clustering of samples at the heatmap S3 Fig . The highest correlation in pro- tein expression was observed among blood-derived samples median R2 0.80 and the lowest correlation was observed among cell culture-derived samples median R2 0.32 which con- firms the high heterogeneity of cancer cell lines. Proteins in secreted fractions mirror tumor alterations To better understand the biological alterations during CRC tumorigenesis following the pipe- line described in Methods we identified differentially-expressed proteins comparing normal mucosa adenomas and CRC tumor samples. First we performed Gene Ontology GO enrich- ment analysis to compare the three types of solid samples Fig 4A . The GO categories signifi- cantly enhanced in tumor samples when compared with the normal mucosa and adenoma were cell cycle GO0007049 telomerase maintenance GO0000723 translation GO0006412 and ribosome biogenesis GO0042254 . These categories are related to an increased proliferation in the tumors. Conversely the most significant biological process decreased during tumor progression was cellular respiration GO0045333 probably due to the Warburg effect 29 . When analysing the GO Cellular Component category there was a significant enrichment of the secreted fraction secretory granule lumen term GO0034774 Fig 4B . This enrichment was found to be higher in the overexpressed proteins when compar- ing Adenoma vs Mucosa Tumor vs Mucosa and Tumor vs Adenoma indicating that the secreted fraction increases through tumor progression in CRC due to the high intestinal secre- tory component. Given the relevance of the secreted fraction in CRC progression11 the level of agreement in protein expression between solid tumor samples and secreted fractions was investigated. Most Fig 3.

To determine concordance the Pearson correlation coefficient r values between solid tumor samples and each secreted source were calculated Fig 4D . On secreted fractions the interstitial fluid and cell culture-derived samples showed greater correlations with the tumor samples than with extracellular vesicles and blood-derived samples. Then we tested whether the secreted fractions displayed similar biological alterations to those found between tumor and mucosa in solid samples Fig 4E . Interstitial fluid and EC vesicle samples to a lower extent were able to replicate the changes observed in the solid tumors where blood-derived samples were not. In addition correlation between the fold-changes in tumor vs mucosa was analysed. Whereas EC vesicles and interstitial fluid samples presented a high correlation with solid samples R 0.48 and R 0.45 respectively blood-derived samples did not R 0.05 S4A Fig . Of note it is the high correlation found between EC vesicles and interstitial fluid samples R 0.80 . We defined as enriched proteins those canonical proteins exclusively or highly expressed in just one of the secreted subgroups S4B Fig . Then enriched proteins of each secreted source were analysed to identify the overrepresented functions in each subgroup S4C Fig . Fig 4.

Enriched proteins from cell culture supernatants and blood- derived samples were mainly involved in wound healing GO0042060 and blood coagula- tion GO0007596 . Moreover in all subgroups enriched proteins were significantly associ- ated with GO Cellular Component categories corresponding to secreted fractions such as EC vesicle GO1903561 or EC region GO0005576 S4D Fig . Overall these analyses suggest that secreted fractions represent a suitable model for the study of protein expression in CRC as they show a remarkable correlation with solid tumor alterations. Concordance between m RNA and protein-based prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer To the best of our knowledge there has been limited investigation into the large-scale concor- dance between gene expression- and protein expression-based biomarkers. To investigate which protein alterations are present at the gene expression level a comparison between tran- scriptomics and proteomics fold-changes in tumor and normal mucosa samples was per- formed. Proteomics data from the solid samples batch was used after normalization into ranked bins. Transcriptomics data from primary tumor and normal mucosa samples was obtained from the GSE41258 public dataset from GEO see -Methods- . Our analysis showed an excellent agreement between transcriptomics and proteomics alterations as shown in a vol- cano plot representing all the quantified proteins Fig 5A and a scatter plot presenting only the significantly altered proteins Fig 5B . Despite the overall concordance we still found some disagreements. To explain these discrepancies we analysed separately proteins that were sig- nificantly altered in either one or both analyses. Firstly we examined the protein expression levels in tumor samples. Proteins significantly altered between tumor and mucosa in the prote- omic analysis showed higher expression ranked values than the proteins corresponding to the altered genes detected in transcriptomics Fig 5C . These results suggest that some of the exclusively-detected transcriptomic alterations were not detected using proteomics because expression values were too low to find differences between conditions. To examine the GO Cellular Component differences three significant representative locations were identified Secretory granule lumen GO0034774 Mitochondrial matrix GO0005759 and Nucleus GO0005634 . We obtained different location profiles depending on the technique used for the detection. Proteomics-derived proteins were mainly enriched in secreted proteins whereas nuclear genes were the most enriched location in transcriptomic-exclusive genes Fig 5D . These findings might be explained by the relatively low expression of transcription splicing and other nuclear factors. Next we evaluated the predictive potential of protein expression and its concordance with the RNA-seq values. Firstly we selected proteins quantified in the CPTAC COADREAD data- set and the corresponding m RNA data in the CPTAC samples within the TCGA COADREAD datasets. CPTAC was selected because is the only CRC public proteomics dataset that contains patient survival data. In addition it is the only dataset in which samples have been analysed both by proteomics and RNA-seq. Then Cox regression analysis was performed to identify proteins or genes associated with survival. Significant proteins in the Cox regression analysis were plotted in scatter plots representing the hazard ratios HR . A relatively low correlation was observed when comparing proteomics CPTAC data with CPTAC and TCGA COAD- READ RNA-seq datasets Fig 5E and 5F . Then the ratio of significant proteins CPTAC and genes TCGA was determined. In the CPTAC dataset from the initial 2 661 analysed pro- teins 142 5.3 were significantly associated with prognosis whereas 285 10.7 genes were PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 9 / 24 significant in the analysis of the corresponding genes in the TCGA dataset Fig 5G . A pie chart showed that 130 30.4 of the significant potential biomarkers were exclusively detected by proteomics Fig 5G . This suggests that potential biomarkers identified by proteomics may go unnoticed when analysing m RNA values and vice versa. Therefore when searching for bio- markers on a large scale it is optimal to integrate proteomics and transcriptomics data to attain a more comprehensive biomarker panel. Validation of experimentally-derived biomarkers using public proteomics datasets As an initial proof-of-concept we applied our strategy to the validation of a recently reported prognostic and predictive signatures for CRC based on the expression of six genes BMP1 CD109 IGFBP3 LTBP1 NPC2 PSAP which were identified through proteomics analysis of Fig 5.

Protein descriptions and their Uni Prot accession numbers can be found in S1 Table. Therefore we determined whether this signature could also be detected in the proteomic datasets according to our in silico reanalysis strategy. At the proteomic level four out of six proteins correspond- ing to the genes CD109 LTBP1 NPC2 and PSAP were detected in more than 50 of the solid tumor samples included in the CPTAC dataset Fig 6A and were considered for their associa- tion with survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis Fig 6B . A clear trend was observed since patients with high expression in all four proteins showed lower overall survival rate. As only four proteins were quantified using proteomics datasets instead of the original calculation of the risk score based on an algorithm including the six genes a simpler approach based on the mean of the four available proteins was performed to classify patients in high and low risk. A previous normalization division by mean was done to avoid the high differences between protein levels. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association of the combined protein expression with poor survival Fig 6C . Furthermore as SEC6 are secreted proteins their pres- ence in blood-derived samples was analysed. In this case all the proteins except BMP1 were detected in blood-derived samples and four of them IGFBP3 LTBP1 NPC2 and PSAP were highly increased in CRC patients Fig 6D . The high levels found in the blood of colorectal patients agree with the previous detection in the secretome and represent a promising added value to the signature. Discovery of new secreted biomarkers using public proteomics datasets Finally we searched for new proteomics-derived prognostic biomarkers as an additional proof-of-concept for our hypothesis. To achieve this we followed the indicated workflow Fig 7A . Proteins quantified in 70 of all solid tumor samples and then at least in 70 of CPTAC samples were selected. Association with survival was determined using Cox regression analy- sis. We identified 130 proteins significantly associated with prognosis Fig 5G . For potential biomarker detection in liquid biopsies selection was restricted to those proteins overexpressed in blood samples from CRC patients. Five candidate biomarkers CD14 MRC2 PPIA PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were obtained. Whereas PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were biomarkers of good prognosis CD14 PPIA and MRC2 were associated with poor prognosis Fig 7B . Protein descriptions and Uni Prot accession numbers can be found in S2 Table. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed a prognostic value when considering all patients Fig 7B or only patients in stages II and III S5A Fig where clinical treatments require more complex decisions. To test if these potential biomarkers could be also used in combination patients were classified in high or low risk according to the expression levels of each protein S5B Fig . The significance of the classi- fication increased when we considered as high-risk patients those in whom at least three of the five proteins classified them as high risk. Kaplan-Meier analysis was significant for either all the patients or stage II and III patients S5C Fig . Next the prognostic efficiency of these proteins was evaluated at the transcriptomic level using the TCGA RNA-seq database and the best cut-off Kaplan-Meier significance. All the cor- responding genes were significant except for TXNDC5 which was close to significance 6A Fig . When a more restrictive Cox regression test was performed these biomarkers showed significance using proteomics data CPTAC but not at the m RNA level TCGA data indi- cating that the signal is stronger at the protein level S6B Fig . Additionally the prognostic value of these biomarkers was evaluated in eight independent transcriptomics datasets by using a log-rank test S6C Fig . Although the biomarkers were not significantly associated with outcome in all the independent datasets the signal was stronger when combining all the cohorts. PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 11 / 24 To further explore the clinical value and potential applications to patient stratification of these biomarkers we explored the expression in the different CRC subtypes according to proteomic Fig 7C and transcriptomic Fig 7D classifications. There was a significant statisti- cal association of the 5 biomarkers with the proteomic classification 31 except for PRDX1. CD14 and MRC2 were more abundantly expressed in the subtype C associated with poor out- come whereas TXNDC5 showed higher expression in subtype D Fig 7C . In contrast the sig- nificance of the association with the transcriptomic-derived consensus molecular subtypes CMS was lower except for CD14 which showed higher expression in the CMS4 and CMS1 subtypes associated with poor prognosis and TXNDC5 that showed more expression in the good prognosis CMS3 subtype. Therefore proteomic markers correlated better with proteo- mic-defined subtypes than with transcriptomics-identified ones. In any case CD14 and TXNDC5 showed strong association with poor and good prognosis respectively in a variety of independent datasets endorsing their value as prognostic biomarkers. Regarding location these biomarkers showed higher expression in serum from CRC patients when compared to healthy controls Fig 7E . PRDX1 CD14 and PPIA were also detected and upregulated in interstitial fluid samples Fig 7F . Finally PPIA and PRDX1 were Fig 6.

In conclu- sion our meta-analysis supports a novel approach for the identification of novel protein bio- markers suitable for detection in liquid biopsies. Moreover our data indicate that for some biomarkers proteomics detection may outperform transcriptomics analysis. Tissue expression and functional analysis of the biomarkers panel To further explore the biological significance of these candidates in CRC tumor samples immunohistochemistry images were retrieved from the Human Protein Atlas HPA 32 S7A Fig .

In any case a significant prognostic value of PPIA p 0.076 PRDX1 p 0.021 and TXNDC5 p 0.033 was con- firmed using the HPA dataset. Next we carried out a functional analysis in order to investigate the potential mechanistic basis of these biomarkers. To identify the proteins associated with the discovered biomarkers we firstly selected those proteins that presented a high Pearson correlation p 0.01 with each biomarker when analysing the solid tumor samples. Then proteins with at least one interac- tion with the biomarkers were analysed using STRING 33 to obtain the interactome of the biomarkers Fig 8A . An interactome analysis based on GO revealed major associations with diverse biological functions Fig 8B . CD14 was mainly associated to inflammatory processes as macrophage inflammation and acute inflammatory response . MRC2 was associated with collagen processing and extracellular matrix organization . PPIA showed interactions with proteins form the protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization and was involved in functions such as NFAT signalling or telomerase activity. Finally the markers associated with good prog- nosis PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were related with similar pathways protein refolding and reg- ulation of cell death suggesting that under cancer-related stress conditions such as redox unbalance or abnormal protein folding these proteins would suppress the cell cycle or partici- pate in the cell death. Discussion Our study provides a direct demonstration of the value of reusing public proteomics datasets for biomarker identification and validation. In this report we reanalysed and integrated twelve public proteomic datasets from CRC samples containing not only solid tumors but also liquid biopsy samples to confirm the prognostic potential of a gene expression-based signature Fig 8.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that public proteomics datasets have been reused and focused in the detection and validation of biomarkers. Large-scale genomics and transcriptomics studies have been conducted for biomarker dis- covery. Although proteomics meta-analysis studies are not yet as common as genomics and transcriptomics studies they are becoming increasingly popular. However manual curation is an essential step to provide the optimal level of metadata annotation and to potentially iden- tify biomarkers from data mining alone 34 A few proteomics meta-analysis studies focusing on human malignancies such as cancer 22 or Alzheimer s disease 35 have already been published. Proteomics meta-analysis studies have some limitations mainly related with the heterogeneity associated to proteomics data workflows and the resulting datasets. To achieve a better data integration and comparability our study was restricted to label-free DDA Data Dependent Acquisition quantification studies. However as original data were acquired in dif- ferent experimental conditions the presence of batch effects was expected. To minimize these batch effects we used a rank-binned normalization 24 25 . Despite the mentioned limitations meta-analysis studies have notable advantages. The main benefit is the possibility of reusing large amounts of data that otherwise would require unnecessary time-consuming and expen- sive resources to be acquired again by MS. In addition integrating multiple studies enables to examine a diverse range of biological conditions which is difficult to achieve experimentally and can expand the number of proteins of interest that are detected. Additionally all data in our study were analysed and processed using the same analysis pipeline and search database which minimizes downstream variability and enables comparison and integration of datasets from different origin. Finally in our view compliance with open data sharing practices is essential 36 37 . Therefore the protein abundance results have been made available in the Expression Atlas resource and can be accessed and visualised there Table 1 . The identification of novel potential biomarkers in CRC is essential for personalized medi- cine enabling the best therapeutic option for each patient. An appropriate categorization of stage II and III patients considering the diversity within CRC can allow consistent monitor- ing and chemotherapy treatment regardless of surgical approaches. With this objective in mind a gene signature called SEC6 30 was reported for the calculation of a risk score based on the RNA levels of six genes predicting the patient outcome and their response to chemo- therapy. Although the survival metadata associated with proteomic datasets is much smaller than those associated with genomics and transcriptomics data we confirmed the prognostic value for four out of six of the proteins. Two of them BMP1 and IGFBP3 were not detected by proteomics in most of the solid tumor samples. However IGFBP3 was found as the most abundant protein in blood-derived samples. The fact that five out of these six proteins can be detected in blood greatly increases the potential of this signature for patient risk and response monitoring. Our proteomic re-use strategy also enabled the identification of novel prognostic bio- markers in CRC using proteomics data alone. The CPTAC dataset was essential in this process as it is the only one that contains survival data. This dataset has been frequently used for con- firmation of previously identified prognostic biomarkers usually through genomics or tran- scriptomics approaches 38 39 . In our study we performed a large-scale analysis identifying all the proteins associated with prognosis according to CPTAC. In contrast to common prac- tice we validated our proteomics discoveries using RNA-seq data to confirm their prognostic potential. We identified five potential prognostic biomarkers CD14 PPIA MRC2 PRDX1 and TXNDC5 . CD14 is a macrophage-associated marker that has been associated with unfa- vourable prognosis in CRC 40 . Peptidylprolyl isomerase A PPIA a.k.a. as cyclophilin A PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 15 / 24 has been related with ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation 41 gastrin cancer serum biomarker 42 and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma 43 . MRC2 Mannose Receptor C Type 2 is a mannose receptor whose expression is upregulated and associated with prognosis in some types of cancer such as glioblastoma bladder ovarian and renal can- cer 44 . GO analysis of these three unfavourable markers showed association with inflamma- tory pathways and extracellular matrix reorganization which are processes linked to invasion and progression. On the other hand for PRDX1 and TXNDC5 identified as favourable prog- nostic biomarkers the GO analysis showed association with cell death regulation. PRDX1 is a peroxiredoxin an enzyme involved in regulating reactive oxygen species. Although its mecha- nism of action is uncertain it has been shown to prevent metastasis and angiogenesis 45 . PRDX1 depletion promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CRC 46 . Finally TXNDC5 is a disulphide isomerase PDI that catalyses protein folding and thiol-dis- ulphide interchange reactions. TXNDC5 promotes survival and proliferation by inducing HIF-1α in hypoxic situations 47 . Although upregulated in different tumours its role in can- cer progression remains unclear 48 In summary the CRC protein abundance/expression landscape resulting from the reanaly- sis of twelve public datasets constitutes a rich source of information for biomarker discovery and validation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a meta-analysis of public proteomics datasets has been used as the basis for biomarker discovery and validation. Addi- tionally we have demonstrated its value to perform in a relatively short period of time the val- idation of previously described biomarkers and the identification of new biomarker panels with potential clinical utility. Methods Dataset selection MS-based proteomics data from studies of human colorectal cancer were selected for reanaly- sis from public repositories included in Proteome Xchange such as PRIDE and j POST and from the CPTAC data portal. These databases were queried for human CRC and the resulting hits were filtered based on the following criteria- i label-free DDA studies where no post- translational modification PTM -enrichment had been performed ii experiments performed on Thermo Fisher Scientific instruments LTQ Orbitrap LTQ Orbitrap Elite LTQ Orbitrap Velos LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD LTQ-Orbitrap XL ETD Orbitrap Fusion and Q-Exactive and iii availability of detailed sample metadata in the original publication or after contacting the original submitters. As a result 10 datasets from PRIDE one dataset each from j POST and one from the CPTAC data portal were downloaded. The details of these datasets are available in Table 1. It is important to highlight that although a small number of additional public data- sets generated using other proteomics approaches were available the 12 chosen datasets repre- sented the vast majority of the relevant CRC public proteomics datasets. All datasets were manually curated and the corresponding information was encoded in a SDRF Sample Data Relationship File linking the MS raw data to the biological conditions. Proteomics raw data processing Proteomics datasets of secretome and tumor samples were analysed in two batches separately. Peptide/protein identification and protein quantification was performed using Max Quant 27 version 2.1.0.0 on a high-performance Linux computing cluster. The input parameters for each dataset such as MS1 and MS2 tolerances digestive enzymes fixed and variable modifica- tions were set as described in their respective publications together with two missed cleavage sites. PSM Peptide Spectrum Match and protein FDR False Discovery Rate levels were set PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 16 / 24 at 1 . Other Max Quant parameter settings were left as default maximum number of modifi- cations per peptide 5 minimum peptide length 7 maximum peptide mass 4 600 Da. For match between runs the minimum match time window was set to 0.7 seconds and the mini- mum retention time alignment window was set to 20 seconds. The Uni Prot Human Reference Proteome one protein sequence per gene set Homo sapiens Uni Prot Sept. 2020. 20 601 sequences was used as the target sequence database. The inbuilt Max Quant contaminant data- base was also used and the decoy database were generated by Max Quant at the time of the analysis on-the-fly by reversing the input database sequences after the respective enzymatic cleavage. Post-processing Max Quant results for each batch were processed downstream to remove potential contami- nants decoys and protein groups which had fewer than 2 PSMs. The protein intensities were normalised using the FOT method as mentioned 25 wherein each protein i BAQ intensity value is scaled to the total amount of signal in a given MS run and transformed to parts per bil- lion ppb . ppb i BAQi 1 4 i BAQi Pi 1 4 1ni BAQi x 1 000 000 000 The bioconductor package mygene 49 was used to assign Ensembl gene identifiers/anno- tations to the protein groups by mapping the majority protein identifiers within each protein group. This step is required for integration into Expression Atlas. Briefly from the Max Quant output file protein Groups.txt the Uni Prot protein accessions within each protein group in the majority protein identifiers columns were individually queried using the query Many function in the mygene package to obtain their respective Ensembl gene symbols and gene identifiers. The protein groups whose protein identifiers were mapped to multiple Ensembl gene symbols/IDs were not used for further downstream analysis. In those cases where two or more protein groups mapped to the same Ensembl gene symbol/ID their median intensity values were considered. The parent genes to which the different protein groups were mapped to are equivalent to canonical proteins in Uni Prot https //www.uniprot.org/help/canonical_ and_isoforms and therefore the term protein abundance is used to describe the protein abun- dance of the canonical protein throughout the manuscript. A detailed flowchart of all post- processing steps is shown in S1 Fig. Protein abundance comparison across datasets For comparison of protein abundances between the two groups of samples secretome and solid tumor samples the normalised i BAQ abundances were transformed into numerical bins. The abundances in ppb were ranked and grouped into 5 bins wherein proteins with the lowest protein abundance values were in bin 1 and those with the highest abundance values were in bin 5. A Pearson correlation coefficient for all samples was calculated on pairwise com- plete observations of bin transformed i BAQ values in R. Samples were hierarchically clustered on columns and rows using Euclidean distances. Differentially expressed proteins and Gene Ontology GO analysis Differentially expressed canonical proteins between tumor and mucosa adenoma and mucosa or adenoma and tumor samples were determined by performing a t-test after ranked bin transformation. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control the FDR. To investi- gate the source-specific protein profile of each subgroup of the secreted samples group we PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Re-using public proteomic datasets PLOS Computational Biology https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828 January 22 2024 17 / 24 identified and further analysed proteins categorized as enriched proteins . Enriched pro- teins were those proteins uniquely quantified in one of the subgroups or proteins with median bin values higher than each median bin value of the rest of the subgroups. Gene ontology GO analysis was performed using g Profiler 50 and Enrichr 51 . Only differentially expressed proteins or Enriched proteins were selected for the analysis. In silico validation and functional enrichment analysis Images and quantifications derived from immunohistochemistry assays were obtained from the HPA 52 . When several antibodies were available for a given protein the most representa- tive was selected for further analysis. Semi-quantitative analysis high medium low and not detected performed and available in HPA was used in this study. The protein interactome was obtained using the STRING database. To restrict the interac- tome to the CRC context only proteins with a strong Pearson correlation p 0.01 with the protein of interest in the solid tumor samples were selected. Next proteins with at least one medium confidence interaction STRING score 0.4 were selected for the final interactome. The interactome was plotted and a GO functional enrichment analysis was performed. Transcriptomics data selection and processing RNA-seq data generated on the Illumina Hi Seq platform for 592 colorectal tumor samples from TCGA COADREAD dataset 53 was downloaded from c Bio Portal 54 . Data was mapped with the RSEM RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization algorithm and normalized using the log2 RSEM 1 method as previously described 55 . RNA-seq data of samples from CPTAC 90 patients were included in the mentioned TCGA COADREAD dataset. However both proteomics and RNA-seq data were acquired only for CPTAC samples. For primary tumor and normal mucosa comparison GSE41258 56 a large dataset con- taining 390 samples from 276 CRC patients was selected from Gene Expression Omnibus GEO . This dataset was selected because contains data from 190 primary tumor and 54 healthy mucosa samples obtained from individuals including a high level of metadata annota- tion age sex stage recurrence location etc . Data was derived from 299 U133A arrays and processed and normalized according to the original publication 56 . Proteomics and transcriptomics data comparison For the comparison between healthy mucosa and tumor samples proteomics and transcrip- tomics data were obtained from the solid samples batch and from the GSE41258 dataset respectively. In both cases a fold-change tumor vs mucosa and an associated p-value were obtained. For the protein expression the data was converted into ranked bins as previously described. The p-value was obtained by a t-test and subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correc- tion. The fold change was obtained as the ratio of the means of the tumor and mucosa sub- groups. Regarding transcriptomics the fold change was obtained as the ratio of the normalized expression of the primary tumor and healthy mucosa subgroups. The p-value was also obtained by a t-test and subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The correlation between both fold changes was examined using scatter and volcano plots. Only differentially expressed canonical proteins were analysed. For the comparison of hazard ratios HR obtained by proteomics and transcriptomics proteomics data from the CPTAC dataset and RNA-seq data from the TCGA and CPTAC datasets were used. The correlation between HR was examined using scatter plots. Only significant proteins using the Cox regression analysis were plotted.

ANOVA tests were performed in order to detect signifi- cant differences in the risk-score between three or more groups. Block design was used to cor- rect the variability corresponding to the batch effects. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan- Meier analysis were performed using the survival and survminer R packages https //CRAN. R-project.org/package survival . Intensity values were transformed to a z-score before survival analysis. For Kaplan-Meier analysis patients were divided into two subgroups high or low expression by the optimal cut-off method using Cutoff Finder 57 . The point at which the log-rank test split was most significant was identified as the optimal cut-off. Integration into Expression Atlas In Expression Atlas protein expression data coming from the individual reanalysis of each dataset is available. The calculated canonical protein abundances mapped as genes and sum- mary files detailing the quality of post-processing of all datasets were integrated as proteomics baseline experiments E-PROT identifiers are available in Table 1 . It should be noted that Expression Atlas mainly provides a dataset centric view so this is why the protein abundance data were integrated in that way. For the overall results described in the manuscript the data- sets were analysed in two batches as explained above to provide an improved control of the FDR at different levels PSM and protein . However it is important to highlight that the con- clusions reached were the same with regards to the described identified biomarkers. They were also significantly associated to survival in the CPTAC dataset and overexpressed in blood coming from CRC patients dataset PXD010458 when using the protein abundance results coming from the individual reanalyses of datasets as integrated in Expression Atlas instead of the combined reanalysis.

The cancer biomarker field has been an object of thorough investigation in the last decades. Despite this colorectal cancer CRC heterogeneity makes it challenging to identify and validate effective prognostic biomarkers for patient classification according to outcome and treatment response. Although a massive amount of proteomics data has been deposited in public data repositories this rich source of information is vastly underused. Here we attempted to reuse public proteomics datasets with two main objectives i to generate hypotheses detection of biomarkers for their posterior/downstream validation and ii to validate using an orthogonal approach a previously described biomarker panel. Twelve CRC public proteomics datasets mostly from the PRIDE database were re-analysed and integrated to create a landscape of protein expression. Samples from both solid and liquid biopsies were included in the reanalysis. Integrating this data with survival annotation data we have validated a six-gene signature for CRC classification at the protein level and identified five new blood-detectable biomarkers CD14 PPIA MRC2 PRDX1 and TXNDC5 associated with CRC prognosis. The prognostic value of these blood-derived proteins was confirmed using additional public datasets supporting their potential clinical value. As a conclusion this proof-of-the-concept study demonstrates the value of re-using public proteomics datasets as the basis to create a useful resource for biomarker discovery and validation. The protein expression data has been made available in the public resource Expression Atlas. in silico Author summary The need for new prognostic biomarkers is one of the main topics of interest in CRC Colorectal Cancer . A potential strategy to address this issue which to the best of our knowledge has not been attempted so far is the combination of different public proteomic studies generated from independent patient cohorts. Despite the abundance of available proteomics data meta-analyses have only been conducted at the genomic and transcriptomic levels so far. In this study we reanalyzed 12 mass spectrometry-based public proteomics datasets. In total the combined dataset included 440 samples from 299 different patients encompassing both solid and liquid biopsies. Consequently we defined a proteomics landscape suitable for assessing protein expression in tumors and normal mucosa its association with patient outcome and its potential detection in liquid biopsies. Furthermore as a proof-of-concept for the data reuse strategy we demonstrated its capacity to validate an experimentally-based SEC6 gene signature at the protein level and to identify new blood-detectable biomarkers. The data generated in this study can be accessed by anyone since all the data have been made available in the Expression Atlas resource. http //dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación RTI2018-095055-B-I00 PID2021-122227OB-I00 and PDC2022-133056-I00 https //orcid.org/0000-0003-1085-2840 Casal J.

Introduction Colorectal cancer CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide accounting for approximately 10 of all diagnosed cancers 1 . Notably the most developed countries present the highest rates of incidence 2 . Regarding global mortality CRC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 3 . CRC is considered a highly heterogeneous disease 4 caused through various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms including microsatellite instability or mutations in oncogenes such as APC TP53 KRAS and BRAF. The molecular heterogeneity leads to variability in the pathogenesis outcome and treatment response 5 . Both clinical and molecular heterogeneity are essential challenges when facing CRC diagnosis and prognosis 6 and to face this heterogeneity several molecular classifications have been proposed 7 . CRC diagnostic procedures have made significant advances in the last years based on the massive use of faecal occult blood screening tests liquid biopsies and the more invasive colonoscopy 8 . However once the disease is detected the current clinical stratification systems based on the pathological staging presents some limitations that fail to identify a relevant number of patients relapsing and/or developing metastases after surgical resection. For those reasons it is especially crucial to identify prognostic biomarkers to categorize patients in stage II and III to prevent recurrence and to identify those patients who should receive more intensive treatments 9 . Although most of the approaches designed to address CRC diagnosis and prognosis have relied so far in samples from solid biopsies 4 10 obtained using highly invasive procedures biomarkers detectable in liquid biopsies are a preferable option for predicting and monitoring patient outcome and response to chemotherapy 11 . Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of secreted proteins on tumor progression and metastasis development 12 . In summary despite significant progress in CRC screening and diagnosis has been achieved 13 the problem of CRC prognosis and classification remains unresolved. Most of the available high-throughput omics data coming from cancer patients are based on DNA and RNA sequencing information. This applies to both solid and liquid biopsies. Indeed most of the attempts to classify CRC are based on transcriptomics data 4 10 . Nevertheless proteins are most often the functional molecules that undertake the translation from genotype into the phenotype. In addition protein-based techniques such as ELISA or immunohistochemistry have demonstrated to be useful tools with clinical relevance 14 . Mass spectrometry MS is the main high-throughput proteomics approach for providing quantitative measurements of protein abundance/expression 15 . Although publicly available genomics and transcriptomics datasets are more in number and scope large relevant proteomics studies such as those performed by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium CPTAC 16 or other independent teams have obtained MS-based protein expression information in CRC samples. Taken together this protein expression data from different datasets can be considered as a robust source of information for biomarker discovery and confirmation. Multiple proteomics datasets are freely available in public repositories. The PRIDE database as the most popular resource in this context 17 together with other open repositories e.g. CPTAC portal 16 j POST 18 contain thousands of proteomics datasets. Public data in these resources coming from different sources can be reanalysed and integrated to obtain a global view and potentially discover new insights. Integrative meta-analyses have already demonstrated to be useful using genomics and transcriptomics data 19 20 . Regarding proteomics quantitative reanalysis and integration of public data is emerging as a potent resource with multiple applications 21 - 25 . To our knowledge no previous studies have addressed prognostic biomarker identification in CRC from this perspective of reusing public proteomics datasets. In the present study we selected reused and integrated 12 public proteomics datasets containing samples from both solid and liquid biopsies of CRC patients. The reanalysed and processed data have been deposited in the Expression Atlas resource 26 to facilitate protein abundance data access and visualisation. In summary we provide a CRC proteomic landscape with the capacity to validate previously reported prognostic biomarkers and to discover new sets of biomarkers demonstrating the potential and value of reusing public proteomics datasets for biomarker discovery. Results Colorectal cancer proteomics datasets and integrative analysis We queried PRIDE 17 j POST 18 and the CPTAC 16 portal for CRC studies and selected 12 publicly available datasets for reanalysis Table 1 . These CRC datasets were divided in two groups corresponding to secreted and solid tumor samples respectively. The secretome group consisted of samples derived from blood cell culture extracellular vesicles exosomes and interstitial fluid whereas the solid tumor sample group consisted of samples derived from mucosa adenoma pre-malignant cellular masses and tumor tissues. The secretome and solid tumor sample groups consisted of 7 and 5 datasets respectively and included paired healthy and cancer samples. The characteristics of the overall patient cohorts included in the datasets are shown in Table 2 . Patient composition of the meta-analysis shows a non-biased proportional distribution of the different sub-classifications of CRC according to mutations chromosomal stability age and sex. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.t001 Table 1 List of the proteomics datasets used in this study.

Each batch consisted of all MS runs from all datasets that were part of a sample group. Protein identification and quantification analysis was performed using Max Quant 27 version 2.1.0.0 on a high-performance computing Linux cluster. In total the datasets contained 2 458 MS runs covering 440 samples from 299 individuals. The number of protein groups peptides and unique peptides identified in the two batches of samples are shown in Table 1 .

Workflow of the selection curation reanalysis and integration of public proteomic dataset containing CRC samples. Protein abundance comparison in solid tumors and secreted samples Protein abundances were calculated for the secretome and solid tumor samples using the intensity-based absolute quantification i BAQ method and normalised by the FOT Fraction of Total method see Methods . We converted the normalised i BAQ abundance values of each sample into five abundance bins as previously described 25 for ease of comparison of abundances across samples and datasets. The abundance bins ranged from bin1 to bin5 denoting proteins with lowest to highest abundance respectively. We mapped the protein identifiers within the protein groups to their respective parent gene names equivalent to canonical proteins in Uni Prot see Methods and hence when describing protein abundances in the manuscript we refer to the abundance of the canonical proteins . Protein identification in solid tumor samples Across all tumor samples we identified a total of 9 711 protein groups which we mapped to 8 949 parent genes canonical proteins . We identified similar numbers of canonical proteins across samples from colon mucosa colon adenoma which are pre-cancerous cell masses and colorectal tumor samples Fig 2A . The dynamic range of protein abundances was similar across tissue samples Fig 2B . Across datasets PXD001676 had the lowest number 29.1 of identified canonical proteins Fig 2C . However dataset PXD001676 showed a higher median protein abundance relative to the other datasets Fig 2D probably due to the fewer number of canonical proteins identified in this dataset. We found that the large majority of canonical proteins was simultaneously present in the three types of samples mucosa adenoma and tumor Fig 2E . Compared to the secreted samples the correlation of protein abundance among tumor tissues was relatively low S2 Fig . The highest correlation was observed in adenoma samples median R 2 0.58 and the lowest correlation was among mucosa samples median R 2 0.49 . 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g002 Fig 2 Colorectal cancer CRC solid samples.

C Number of canonical proteins identified across different datasets. D Range of normalised i BAQ protein abundances across different datasets. E Number of canonical proteins identified across either one two or three of the different solid samples subgroups mucosa adenoma and tumor . The number within the parenthesis indicate the number of samples. Protein identification in secreted samples We obtained 5 861 protein groups from the secreted samples which were mapped to 5 091 parent genes canonical proteins . We identified a large number of proteins in samples from interstitial fluid 87.5 and extracellular vesicles and exosomes 74.2 while comparatively less proteins were identified in blood-derived 37.2 and cell culture samples 39.4 Fig 3A . The dynamic range of protein abundances across secreted samples and datasets is shown Fig 3B and 3D . Among datasets the largest numbers of canonical proteins were identified in datasets PXD005709 JPST000867 and PXD005693 Fig 3C . The median protein abundance was highest in cell culture-derived samples compared to other samples and similarly dataset PXD020454 had a higher median protein abundance likely due to the low number of canonical proteins identified in this dataset. The number of canonical proteins identified across all subgroups was relatively low likely influenced by the unequal distribution of identifications among the subgroups. Indeed the majority of canonical proteins were exclusively present in either two or three of the subgroups Fig 3E . We used the binned protein abundances to compare the correlation of protein abundances across secreted samples. We also observed a good correlation and clustering of samples at the heatmap S3 Fig . The highest correlation in protein expression was observed among blood-derived samples median R 2 0.80 and the lowest correlation was observed among cell culture-derived samples median R 2 0.32 which confirms the high heterogeneity of cancer cell lines. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g003 Fig 3 Colorectal cancer secreted samples.

Proteins in secreted fractions mirror tumor alterations To better understand the biological alterations during CRC tumorigenesis following the pipeline described in Methods we identified differentially-expressed proteins comparing normal mucosa adenomas and CRC tumor samples. First we performed Gene Ontology GO enrichment analysis to compare the three types of solid samples Fig 4A . The GO categories significantly enhanced in tumor samples when compared with the normal mucosa and adenoma were cell cycle GO0007049 telomerase maintenance GO0000723 translation GO0006412 and ribosome biogenesis GO0042254 . These categories are related to an increased proliferation in the tumors. Conversely the most significant biological process decreased during tumor progression was cellular respiration GO0045333 probably due to the Warburg effect 29 . When analysing the GO Cellular Component category there was a significant enrichment of the secreted fraction secretory granule lumen term GO0034774 Fig 4B . This enrichment was found to be higher in the overexpressed proteins when comparing Adenoma vs Mucosa Tumor vs Mucosa and Tumor vs Adenoma indicating that the secreted fraction increases through tumor progression in CRC due to the high intestinal secretory component. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g004 Fig 4 Analysis of GO enrichment and concordance between solid and secreted samples.

C Venn diagram representing the detected canonical proteins in solid and secreted samples. D Boxplot showing the correlation between solid samples and each of the subgroups of secreted samples. E Significance of enrichment in GO Biological Process categories of altered proteins tumor vs normal mucosa in different secreted subgroups. Given the relevance of the secreted fraction in CRC progression 11 the level of agreement in protein expression between solid tumor samples and secreted fractions was investigated. Most of the proteins quantified in the secreted fractions were also present in the solid samples Fig 4C . To determine concordance the Pearson correlation coefficient r values between solid tumor samples and each secreted source were calculated Fig 4D . On secreted fractions the interstitial fluid and cell culture-derived samples showed greater correlations with the tumor samples than with extracellular vesicles and blood-derived samples. Then we tested whether the secreted fractions displayed similar biological alterations to those found between tumor and mucosa in solid samples Fig 4E . Interstitial fluid and EC vesicle samples to a lower extent were able to replicate the changes observed in the solid tumors where blood-derived samples were not. In addition correlation between the fold-changes in tumor vs mucosa was analysed. Whereas EC vesicles and interstitial fluid samples presented a high correlation with solid samples R 0.48 and R 0.45 respectively blood-derived samples did not R 0.05 S4A Fig . Of note it is the high correlation found between EC vesicles and interstitial fluid samples R 0.80 . We defined as enriched proteins those canonical proteins exclusively or highly expressed in just one of the secreted subgroups S4B Fig . Then enriched proteins of each secreted source were analysed to identify the overrepresented functions in each subgroup S4C Fig . Interstitial fluid proteins were particularly relevant in the study of cellular respiration GO0045333 and translation GO0006412 while EC vesicles were the best option for the cell cycle GO0007049 . Enriched proteins from cell culture supernatants and blood-derived samples were mainly involved in wound healing GO0042060 and blood coagulation GO0007596 . Moreover in all subgroups enriched proteins were significantly associated with GO Cellular Component categories corresponding to secreted fractions such as EC vesicle GO1903561 or EC region GO0005576 S4D Fig . Overall these analyses suggest that secreted fractions represent a suitable model for the study of protein expression in CRC as they show a remarkable correlation with solid tumor alterations. Concordance between m RNA and protein-based prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer To the best of our knowledge there has been limited investigation into the large-scale concordance between gene expression- and protein expression-based biomarkers. To investigate which protein alterations are present at the gene expression level a comparison between transcriptomics and proteomics fold-changes in tumor and normal mucosa samples was performed. Proteomics data from the solid samples batch was used after normalization into ranked bins. Transcriptomics data from primary tumor and normal mucosa samples was obtained from the GSE41258 public dataset from GEO see - Methods - . Our analysis showed an excellent agreement between transcriptomics and proteomics alterations as shown in a volcano plot representing all the quantified proteins Fig 5A and a scatter plot presenting only the significantly altered proteins Fig 5B . Despite the overall concordance we still found some disagreements. To explain these discrepancies we analysed separately proteins that were significantly altered in either one or both analyses. Firstly we examined the protein expression levels in tumor samples. Proteins significantly altered between tumor and mucosa in the proteomic analysis showed higher expression ranked values than the proteins corresponding to the altered genes detected in transcriptomics Fig 5C . These results suggest that some of the exclusively-detected transcriptomic alterations were not detected using proteomics because expression values were too low to find differences between conditions. To examine the GO Cellular Component differences three significant representative locations were identified Secretory granule lumen GO0034774 Mitochondrial matrix GO0005759 and Nucleus GO0005634 . We obtained different location profiles depending on the technique used for the detection. Proteomics-derived proteins were mainly enriched in secreted proteins whereas nuclear genes were the most enriched location in transcriptomic-exclusive genes Fig 5D . These findings might be explained by the relatively low expression of transcription splicing and other nuclear factors. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g005 Fig 5 Correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics analysis.

G Portion of the canonical proteins significantly associated with survival according to proteomics CPTAC and/or transcriptomics TCGA data. Significance was calculated by Cox regression analysis. Chart pie of all the significant associated m RNA TCGA and proteins CPTAC . Next we evaluated the predictive potential of protein expression and its concordance with the RNA-seq values. Firstly we selected proteins quantified in the CPTAC COADREAD dataset and the corresponding m RNA data in the CPTAC samples within the TCGA COADREAD datasets. CPTAC was selected because is the only CRC public proteomics dataset that contains patient survival data. In addition it is the only dataset in which samples have been analysed both by proteomics and RNA-seq. Then Cox regression analysis was performed to identify proteins or genes associated with survival. Significant proteins in the Cox regression analysis were plotted in scatter plots representing the hazard ratios HR . A relatively low correlation was observed when comparing proteomics CPTAC data with CPTAC and TCGA COADREAD RNA-seq datasets Fig 5E and 5F . Then the ratio of significant proteins CPTAC and genes TCGA was determined. In the CPTAC dataset from the initial 2 661 analysed proteins 142 5.3 were significantly associated with prognosis whereas 285 10.7 genes were significant in the analysis of the corresponding genes in the TCGA dataset Fig 5G . A pie chart showed that 130 30.4 of the significant potential biomarkers were exclusively detected by proteomics Fig 5G . This suggests that potential biomarkers identified by proteomics may go unnoticed when analysing m RNA values and vice versa. Therefore when searching for biomarkers on a large scale it is optimal to integrate proteomics and transcriptomics data to attain a more comprehensive biomarker panel. Validation of experimentally-derived biomarkers using public proteomics datasets As an initial proof-of-concept we applied our strategy to the validation of a recently reported prognostic and predictive signatures for CRC based on the expression of six genes BMP1 CD109 IGFBP3 LTBP1 NPC2 PSAP which were identified through proteomics analysis of the secretoma of metastatic cancer cells and validated in transcriptomics datasets 30 . Protein descriptions and their Uni Prot accession numbers can be found in S1 Table . Therefore we determined whether this signature could also be detected in the proteomic datasets according to our in silico reanalysis strategy. At the proteomic level four out of six proteins corresponding to the genes CD109 LTBP1 NPC2 and PSAP were detected in more than 50 of the solid tumor samples included in the CPTAC dataset Fig 6A and were considered for their association with survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis Fig 6B . A clear trend was observed since patients with high expression in all four proteins showed lower overall survival rate. As only four proteins were quantified using proteomics datasets instead of the original calculation of the risk score based on an algorithm including the six genes a simpler approach based on the mean of the four available proteins was performed to classify patients in high and low risk. A previous normalization division by mean was done to avoid the high differences between protein levels. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association of the combined protein expression with poor survival Fig 6C . Furthermore as SEC6 are secreted proteins their presence in blood-derived samples was analysed. In this case all the proteins except BMP1 were detected in blood-derived samples and four of them IGFBP3 LTBP1 NPC2 and PSAP were highly increased in CRC patients Fig 6D . The high levels found in the blood of colorectal patients agree with the previous detection in the secretome and represent a promising added value to the signature. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g006 Fig 6 Validation at the proteomic level of the experimentally-based signature SEC6.

Mean protein expression of CD109 LTPB1 NPC2 and PSAP was used for classification. P values were obtained by log-rank test. D SEC6 proteins distribution across blood-derived samples. Discovery of new secreted biomarkers using public proteomics datasets Finally we searched for new proteomics-derived prognostic biomarkers as an additional proof-of-concept for our hypothesis. To achieve this we followed the indicated workflow Fig 7A . Proteins quantified in 70 of all solid tumor samples and then at least in 70 of CPTAC samples were selected. Association with survival was determined using Cox regression analysis. We identified 130 proteins significantly associated with prognosis Fig 5G . For potential biomarker detection in liquid biopsies selection was restricted to those proteins overexpressed in blood samples from CRC patients. Five candidate biomarkers CD14 MRC2 PPIA PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were obtained. Whereas PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were biomarkers of good prognosis CD14 PPIA and MRC2 were associated with poor prognosis Fig 7B . Protein descriptions and Uni Prot accession numbers can be found in S2 Table . Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed a prognostic value when considering all patients Fig 7B or only patients in stages II and III S5A Fig where clinical treatments require more complex decisions. To test if these potential biomarkers could be also used in combination patients were classified in high or low risk according to the expression levels of each protein S5B Fig . The significance of the classification increased when we considered as high-risk patients those in whom at least three of the five proteins classified them as high risk. Kaplan-Meier analysis was significant for either all the patients or stage II and III patients S5C Fig . 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g007 Fig 7 Identification of blood-detectable prognostic biomarkers.

C Distribution of the protein expression ppb according to the proteomic subtypes classification 59 . D Distribution of the protein expression ppb according to the CMS classifier. E CD14 MRC2 PPIA PRDX1 TXNDC5 distribution across blood-derived samples. F PRDX1 CD14 and PPIA distribution across interstitial fluid from tumor and mucosa according to the PXD005693 dataset. G PPIA and PRDX1distribution across EC vesicles from tumor and adjacent tissue according to the JPST000867 dataset. Next the prognostic efficiency of these proteins was evaluated at the transcriptomic level using the TCGA RNA-seq database and the best cut-off Kaplan-Meier significance. All the corresponding genes were significant except for TXNDC5 which was close to significance 6A Fig . When a more restrictive Cox regression test was performed these biomarkers showed significance using proteomics data CPTAC but not at the m RNA level TCGA data indicating that the signal is stronger at the protein level S6B Fig . Additionally the prognostic value of these biomarkers was evaluated in eight independent transcriptomics datasets by using a log-rank test S6C Fig . Although the biomarkers were not significantly associated with outcome in all the independent datasets the signal was stronger when combining all the cohorts. To further explore the clinical value and potential applications to patient stratification of these biomarkers we explored the expression in the different CRC subtypes according to proteomic Fig 7C and transcriptomic Fig 7D classifications. There was a significant statistical association of the 5 biomarkers with the proteomic classification 31 except for PRDX1. CD14 and MRC2 were more abundantly expressed in the subtype C associated with poor outcome whereas TXNDC5 showed higher expression in subtype D Fig 7C . In contrast the significance of the association with the transcriptomic-derived consensus molecular subtypes CMS was lower except for CD14 which showed higher expression in the CMS4 and CMS1 subtypes associated with poor prognosis and TXNDC5 that showed more expression in the good prognosis CMS3 subtype. Therefore proteomic markers correlated better with proteomic-defined subtypes than with transcriptomics-identified ones. In any case CD14 and TXNDC5 showed strong association with poor and good prognosis respectively in a variety of independent datasets endorsing their value as prognostic biomarkers. Regarding location these biomarkers showed higher expression in serum from CRC patients when compared to healthy controls Fig 7E . PRDX1 CD14 and PPIA were also detected and upregulated in interstitial fluid samples Fig 7F . Finally PPIA and PRDX1 were both detected and overexpressed in tumor-derived extracellular vesicles Fig 7G . In conclusion our meta-analysis supports a novel approach for the identification of novel protein biomarkers suitable for detection in liquid biopsies. Moreover our data indicate that for some biomarkers proteomics detection may outperform transcriptomics analysis. Tissue expression and functional analysis of the biomarkers panel To further explore the biological significance of these candidates in CRC tumor samples immunohistochemistry images were retrieved from the Human Protein Atlas HPA 32 S7A Fig . While PPIA PRDX1 and TXNDC5 showed abundant expression in most samples the detection of MRC2 and CD14 was lower S7B Fig likely because they are mainly stromal proteins expressed by fibroblasts and macrophages respectively. In any case a significant prognostic value of PPIA p 0.076 PRDX1 p 0.021 and TXNDC5 p 0.033 was confirmed using the HPA dataset. Next we carried out a functional analysis in order to investigate the potential mechanistic basis of these biomarkers. To identify the proteins associated with the discovered biomarkers we firstly selected those proteins that presented a high Pearson correlation p 0.01 with each biomarker when analysing the solid tumor samples. Then proteins with at least one interaction with the biomarkers were analysed using STRING 33 to obtain the interactome of the biomarkers Fig 8A . An interactome analysis based on GO revealed major associations with diverse biological functions Fig 8B . CD14 was mainly associated to inflammatory processes as macrophage inflammation and acute inflammatory response . MRC2 was associated with collagen processing and extracellular matrix organization . PPIA showed interactions with proteins form the protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization and was involved in functions such as NFAT signalling or telomerase activity. Finally the markers associated with good prognosis PRDX1 and TXNDC5 were related with similar pathways protein refolding and regulation of cell death suggesting that under cancer-related stress conditions such as redox unbalance or abnormal protein folding these proteins would suppress the cell cycle or participate in the cell death. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011828.g008 Fig 8 Functional analysis of the identified biomarkers.

Discussion Our study provides a direct demonstration of the value of reusing public proteomics datasets for biomarker identification and validation. In this report we reanalysed and integrated twelve public proteomic datasets from CRC samples containing not only solid tumors but also liquid biopsy samples to confirm the prognostic potential of a gene expression-based signature SEC6 at the proteomic level 30 but also for the discovery of new candidate biomarkers capable of predicting patient outcome CD14 MRC2 PPIA PRDX1 TXNDC5 . To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that public proteomics datasets have been reused and focused in the detection and validation of biomarkers. Large-scale genomics and transcriptomics studies have been conducted for biomarker discovery. Although proteomics meta-analysis studies are not yet as common as genomics and transcriptomics studies they are becoming increasingly popular. However manual curation is an essential step to provide the optimal level of metadata annotation and to potentially identify biomarkers from data mining alone 34 A few proteomics meta-analysis studies focusing on human malignancies such as cancer 22 or Alzheimer s disease 35 have already been published. Proteomics meta-analysis studies have some limitations mainly related with the heterogeneity associated to proteomics data workflows and the resulting datasets. To achieve a better data integration and comparability our study was restricted to label-free DDA Data Dependent Acquisition quantification studies. However as original data were acquired in different experimental conditions the presence of batch effects was expected. To minimize these batch effects we used a rank-binned normalization 24 25 . Despite the mentioned limitations meta-analysis studies have notable advantages. The main benefit is the possibility of reusing large amounts of data that otherwise would require unnecessary time-consuming and expensive resources to be acquired again by MS. In addition integrating multiple studies enables to examine a diverse range of biological conditions which is difficult to achieve experimentally and can expand the number of proteins of interest that are detected. Additionally all data in our study were analysed and processed using the same analysis pipeline and search database which minimizes downstream variability and enables comparison and integration of datasets from different origin. Finally in our view compliance with open data sharing practices is essential 36 37 . Therefore the protein abundance results have been made available in the Expression Atlas resource and can be accessed and visualised there Table 1 . The identification of novel potential biomarkers in CRC is essential for personalized medicine enabling the best therapeutic option for each patient. An appropriate categorization of stage II and III patients considering the diversity within CRC can allow consistent monitoring and chemotherapy treatment regardless of surgical approaches. With this objective in mind a gene signature called SEC6 30 was reported for the calculation of a risk score based on the RNA levels of six genes predicting the patient outcome and their response to chemotherapy. Although the survival metadata associated with proteomic datasets is much smaller than those associated with genomics and transcriptomics data we confirmed the prognostic value for four out of six of the proteins. Two of them BMP1 and IGFBP3 were not detected by proteomics in most of the solid tumor samples. However IGFBP3 was found as the most abundant protein in blood-derived samples. The fact that five out of these six proteins can be detected in blood greatly increases the potential of this signature for patient risk and response monitoring. Our proteomic re-use strategy also enabled the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers in CRC using proteomics data alone. The CPTAC dataset was essential in this process as it is the only one that contains survival data. This dataset has been frequently used for confirmation of previously identified prognostic biomarkers usually through genomics or transcriptomics approaches 38 39 . In our study we performed a large-scale analysis identifying all the proteins associated with prognosis according to CPTAC. In contrast to common practice we validated our proteomics discoveries using RNA-seq data to confirm their prognostic potential. We identified five potential prognostic biomarkers CD14 PPIA MRC2 PRDX1 and TXNDC5 . CD14 is a macrophage-associated marker that has been associated with unfavourable prognosis in CRC 40 . Peptidylprolyl isomerase A PPIA a.k.a. as cyclophilin A has been related with ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation 41 gastrin cancer serum biomarker 42 and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma 43 . MRC2 Mannose Receptor C Type 2 is a mannose receptor whose expression is upregulated and associated with prognosis in some types of cancer such as glioblastoma bladder ovarian and renal cancer 44 . GO analysis of these three unfavourable markers showed association with inflammatory pathways and extracellular matrix reorganization which are processes linked to invasion and progression. On the other hand for PRDX1 and TXNDC5 identified as favourable prognostic biomarkers the GO analysis showed association with cell death regulation. PRDX1 is a peroxiredoxin an enzyme involved in regulating reactive oxygen species. Although its mechanism of action is uncertain it has been shown to prevent metastasis and angiogenesis 45 . PRDX1 depletion promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CRC 46 . Finally TXNDC5 is a disulphide isomerase PDI that catalyses protein folding and thiol-disulphide interchange reactions. TXNDC5 promotes survival and proliferation by inducing HIF-1α in hypoxic situations 47 . Although upregulated in different tumours its role in cancer progression remains unclear 48 In summary the CRC protein abundance/expression landscape resulting from the reanalysis of twelve public datasets constitutes a rich source of information for biomarker discovery and validation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a meta-analysis of public proteomics datasets has been used as the basis for biomarker discovery and validation. Additionally we have demonstrated its value to perform in a relatively short period of time the validation of previously described biomarkers and the identification of new biomarker panels with potential clinical utility. Methods Dataset selection MS-based proteomics data from studies of human colorectal cancer were selected for reanalysis from public repositories included in Proteome Xchange such as PRIDE and j POST and from the CPTAC data portal. These databases were queried for human CRC and the resulting hits were filtered based on the following criteria- i label-free DDA studies where no post-translational modification PTM -enrichment had been performed ii experiments performed on Thermo Fisher Scientific instruments LTQ Orbitrap LTQ Orbitrap Elite LTQ Orbitrap Velos LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD LTQ-Orbitrap XL ETD Orbitrap Fusion and Q-Exactive and iii availability of detailed sample metadata in the original publication or after contacting the original submitters. As a result 10 datasets from PRIDE one dataset each from j POST and one from the CPTAC data portal were downloaded. The details of these datasets are available in Table 1 . It is important to highlight that although a small number of additional public datasets generated using other proteomics approaches were available the 12 chosen datasets represented the vast majority of the relevant CRC public proteomics datasets. All datasets were manually curated and the corresponding information was encoded in a SDRF Sample Data Relationship File linking the MS raw data to the biological conditions. Proteomics raw data processing Proteomics datasets of secretome and tumor samples were analysed in two batches separately. Peptide/protein identification and protein quantification was performed using Max Quant 27 version 2.1.0.0 on a high-performance Linux computing cluster. The input parameters for each dataset such as MS1 and MS2 tolerances digestive enzymes fixed and variable modifications were set as described in their respective publications together with two missed cleavage sites. PSM Peptide Spectrum Match and protein FDR False Discovery Rate levels were set at 1 . Other Max Quant parameter settings were left as default maximum number of modifications per peptide 5 minimum peptide length 7 maximum peptide mass 4 600 Da. For match between runs the minimum match time window was set to 0.7 seconds and the minimum retention time alignment window was set to 20 seconds. The Uni Prot Human Reference Proteome one protein sequence per gene set Homo sapiens Uni Prot Sept. 2020. 20 601 sequences was used as the target sequence database. The inbuilt Max Quant contaminant database was also used and the decoy database were generated by Max Quant at the time of the analysis on-the-fly by reversing the input database sequences after the respective enzymatic cleavage. Post-processing Max Quant results for each batch were processed downstream to remove potential contaminants decoys and protein groups which had fewer than 2 PSMs. The protein intensities were normalised using the FOT method as mentioned 25 wherein each protein i BAQ intensity value is scaled to the total amount of signal in a given MS run and transformed to parts per billion ppb . p p b _ i B A Q i i B A Q i i 1 n i B A Q i x 1 000 000 000 The bioconductor package mygene 49 was used to assign Ensembl gene identifiers/annotations to the protein groups by mapping the majority protein identifiers within each protein group. This step is required for integration into Expression Atlas. Briefly from the Max Quant output file protein Groups.txt the Uni Prot protein accessions within each protein group in the majority protein identifiers columns were individually queried using the query Many function in the mygene package to obtain their respective Ensembl gene symbols and gene identifiers. The protein groups whose protein identifiers were mapped to multiple Ensembl gene symbols/IDs were not used for further downstream analysis. In those cases where two or more protein groups mapped to the same Ensembl gene symbol/ID their median intensity values were considered. The parent genes to which the different protein groups were mapped to are equivalent to canonical proteins in Uni Prot https //www.uniprot.org/help/canonical_and_isoforms and therefore the term protein abundance is used to describe the protein abundance of the canonical protein throughout the manuscript. A detailed flowchart of all post-processing steps is shown in S1 Fig . Protein abundance comparison across datasets For comparison of protein abundances between the two groups of samples secretome and solid tumor samples the normalised i BAQ abundances were transformed into numerical bins. The abundances in ppb were ranked and grouped into 5 bins wherein proteins with the lowest protein abundance values were in bin 1 and those with the highest abundance values were in bin 5. A Pearson correlation coefficient for all samples was calculated on pairwise complete observations of bin transformed i BAQ values in R. Samples were hierarchically clustered on columns and rows using Euclidean distances. Differentially expressed proteins and Gene Ontology GO analysis Differentially expressed canonical proteins between tumor and mucosa adenoma and mucosa or adenoma and tumor samples were determined by performing a t-test after ranked bin transformation. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control the FDR. To investigate the source-specific protein profile of each subgroup of the secreted samples group we identified and further analysed proteins categorized as enriched proteins . Enriched proteins were those proteins uniquely quantified in one of the subgroups or proteins with median bin values higher than each median bin value of the rest of the subgroups. Gene ontology GO analysis was performed using g Profiler 50 and Enrichr 51 . Only differentially expressed proteins or Enriched proteins were selected for the analysis. In silico validation and functional enrichment analysis Images and quantifications derived from immunohistochemistry assays were obtained from the HPA 52 . When several antibodies were available for a given protein the most representative was selected for further analysis. Semi-quantitative analysis high medium low and not detected performed and available in HPA was used in this study. The protein interactome was obtained using the STRING database. To restrict the interactome to the CRC context only proteins with a strong Pearson correlation p 0.01 with the protein of interest in the solid tumor samples were selected. Next proteins with at least one medium confidence interaction STRING score 0.4 were selected for the final interactome. The interactome was plotted and a GO functional enrichment analysis was performed. Transcriptomics data selection and processing RNA-seq data generated on the Illumina Hi Seq platform for 592 colorectal tumor samples from TCGA COADREAD dataset 53 was downloaded from c Bio Portal 54 . Data was mapped with the RSEM RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization algorithm and normalized using the log 2 RSEM 1 method as previously described 55 . RNA-seq data of samples from CPTAC 90 patients were included in the mentioned TCGA COADREAD dataset. However both proteomics and RNA-seq data were acquired only for CPTAC samples. For primary tumor and normal mucosa comparison GSE41258 56 a large dataset containing 390 samples from 276 CRC patients was selected from Gene Expression Omnibus GEO . This dataset was selected because contains data from 190 primary tumor and 54 healthy mucosa samples obtained from individuals including a high level of metadata annotation age sex stage recurrence location etc . Data was derived from 299 U133A arrays and processed and normalized according to the original publication 56 . Proteomics and transcriptomics data comparison For the comparison between healthy mucosa and tumor samples proteomics and transcriptomics data were obtained from the solid samples batch and from the GSE41258 dataset respectively. In both cases a fold-change tumor vs mucosa and an associated p-value were obtained. For the protein expression the data was converted into ranked bins as previously described. The p-value was obtained by a t-test and subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The fold change was obtained as the ratio of the means of the tumor and mucosa subgroups. Regarding transcriptomics the fold change was obtained as the ratio of the normalized expression of the primary tumor and healthy mucosa subgroups. The p-value was also obtained by a t-test and subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The correlation between both fold changes was examined using scatter and volcano plots. Only differentially expressed canonical proteins were analysed. For the comparison of hazard ratios HR obtained by proteomics and transcriptomics proteomics data from the CPTAC dataset and RNA-seq data from the TCGA and CPTAC datasets were used. The correlation between HR was examined using scatter plots. Only significant proteins using the Cox regression analysis were plotted. Statistical analysis The significance of protein expression differences between groups was obtained by using two-sample t tests for each protein or gene. ANOVA tests were performed in order to detect significant differences in the risk-score between three or more groups. Block design was used to correct the variability corresponding to the batch effects. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed using the survival and survminer R packages https //CRAN.R-project.org/package survival . Intensity values were transformed to a z-score before survival analysis. For Kaplan-Meier analysis patients were divided into two subgroups high or low expression by the optimal cut-off method using Cutoff Finder 57 . The point at which the log-rank test split was most significant was identified as the optimal cut-off. Integration into Expression Atlas In Expression Atlas protein expression data coming from the individual reanalysis of each dataset is available. The calculated canonical protein abundances mapped as genes and summary files detailing the quality of post-processing of all datasets were integrated as proteomics baseline experiments E-PROT identifiers are available in Table 1 . It should be noted that Expression Atlas mainly provides a dataset centric view so this is why the protein abundance data were integrated in that way. For the overall results described in the manuscript the datasets were analysed in two batches as explained above to provide an improved control of the FDR at different levels PSM and protein . However it is important to highlight that the conclusions reached were the same with regards to the described identified biomarkers. They were also significantly associated to survival in the CPTAC dataset and overexpressed in blood coming from CRC patients dataset PXD010458 when using the protein abundance results coming from the individual reanalyses of datasets as integrated in Expression Atlas instead of the combined reanalysis.
