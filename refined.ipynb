In addition to temperature/salinity measure- ments Biogeochemical-Argo BGC-Argo profiling floats are capable of autonomously observing at high- frequency bio-optical properties such as the chlorophyll fluorescence a proxy of the chlorophyll a concen- tration Chla the particulate backscattering coefficient bbp a proxy of the stock of particulate organic car- bon and the light available for photosynthesis. We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of more than 8 500 multivariable profiles collected in various oceanic conditions from subpolar waters to subtropical gyres. Our objective is to refine previously established Chla versus bbp relationships and gain insights into the sources of vertical seasonal and regional variability in this relationship. Despite some regional seasonal and vertical variations a general covariation occurs at a global scale. We distinguish two main contrasted situations: 1 concomitant changes in Chla and bbp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton biomass e.g. in subpolar regimes 2 a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclima- tion or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles e.g. in subtropical regimes. The variability in the bbp:Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially influenced by the type of particles and by photoacclimation processes. The large BGC-Argo database helps identifying the spatial and temporal scales at which this ratio is predominantly driven by one or the other of these two factors. 1. Introduction Our ability to observe the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and associated carbon fluxes on relevant space and time scales considerably limits our understanding and prediction skills of the biogeochemical role of phytoplankton in the carbon biological pump Honjo et al. 2014 Legendre et al. 2015 Volk Hoffert 1985 . For example in situ measurements of primary production and phytoplankton carbon biomass are par- ticularly challenging and remain scarce although novel promising techniques have been recently proposed Graff et al. 2012 2015 Riser Johnson 2008 . To overcome space-time coverage sampling limitations bio- optical oceanographers have implemented optical sensors on a variety of in situ or remote platforms from research vessels and moorings to ocean color satellites gliders and profiling floats each with specific com- plementary space-time observation scales Claustre et al. 2010 Dickey 2003 . Such platforms enable to mon- itor bio-optical properties that serve as proxies for major biogeochemical variables. Those include the concentration of chlorophyll a Chla and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 700 nm hereafter referred simply as bbp . The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phyto- plankton carbon biomass Cullen 1982 Siegel et al. 2013 although it is well known that the ratio of Chla to carbon shows large fluctuations driven by a variety of factors such as phytoplankton physiology Alvarez et al. 2016 Geider 1993 Staehr et al. 2002 or community composition Geider et al. 1997 Halsey Jones 2015 Mac Intyre et al. 2002 . In the absence of mineral particles i.e. in most open ocean waters bbp gener- ally covaries with and is therefore used as a proxy of the stock of particulate organic carbon POC Bishop Key Points: The bbp-to-Chla relationship varies along the water column as well as with seasons and oceanic regions The bbp-to-Chla ratio is a valuable biogeochemical proxy for assessing the nature of the particulate assemblage and revealing photoacclimation processes The BGC-Argo float network yields an unprecedented amount of quality data for studying biogeochemical processes at a global scale and along the vertical dimension Supporting Information: Supporting Information S1 Supporting Information S2 Supporting Information S3 Table S1 Table S2 Table S3 Correspondence to: M.

However changes in the nature composition and size of the particle assemblage may cause large variability in the bbp signal and in the POC-to-bbp relationship Bishop 2009 Flory et al. 2004 Gardner et al. 2006 Stramski et al. 2008 . Examining bio-optical relationships which for example link the inherent optical properties of particles such as absorption or scattering to Chla has long been an area of active research in bio-optical oceanography Bricaud et al. 1995 Huot Antoine 2016 Mitchell 1992 Mitchell Holm-Hansen 1991 Morel et al. 2007 Organelli et al. 2017a Smith Baker 1978a Szeto et al. 2011 . Among different types of applications bio- optical relationships enable deriving biogeochemical information over a broad range of space and time scales from in situ or remote optical measurements Huot et al. 2007 Loisel et al. 2002 Siegel et al. 2005 . Such relationships are also used in semianalytical inverse models to interpret remote sensing ocean color data Gordon et al. 1988 Loisel Morel 1998 Morel Maritorena 2001 . Various studies focused on the relationship between Chla and bbp using data from ocean color remote sensing Reynolds et al. 2001 Stramska et al. 2003 field cruises Dall Olmo et al. 2009 Huot et al. 2008 fixed mooring Antoine et al. 2011 or Biogeochemical-Argo BGC-Argo profiling floats Xing et al. 2014 . All of these studies confirmed the principle of the bio-optical assumption Siegel et al. 2005 Smith Baker 1978b suggesting that in open ocean waters the optical properties of a water mass covary to a first order with Chla. Yet depending on the considered data set previous studies also indicate large second-order variability around the mean bbp versus Chla power law relationship Brown et al. 2008 Huot et al. 2008 Xing et al. 2014 . Restricted to a given period of time region or trophic regime and mainly to the surface layer of the water column these studies did not lead to a thorough characterization of the variability in the relationship between Chla and bbp over the full range of environments encountered in the open ocean. In addition these studies involved different methodologies for bbp measurements or retrievals so that it is difficult to untangle regional and/or seasonal variability from possible methodological biases Sullivan et al. 2013 . The recently launched network of BGC-Argo profiling floats is progressively transforming our capability to observe optical properties and biogeochemical processes in the oceans Biogeochemical-Argo Planning Group 2016 Claustre et al. 2010 IOCCG 2011 Johnson Claustre 2016 . The current BGC-Argo bio-optical database has drastically increased over recent years and now encompasses observations collected in a broad range of hydrological trophic and bio-optical conditions encountered in the world s open oceans Organelli et al. 2017a 2017b . Based on homogeneous measurements and processing methodologies this database offers a unique opportunity to comprehensively reassess bio-optical relationships. Based on the analysis of more than 8 500 multivariable profiles collected within the water column 0-1 000 m by BGC-Argo floats this study aims to i investigate the natural variability around the mean statistical bbp-to-Chla relationship at the vertical regional and seasonal scales and ii identify the underlying sources of variability. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. BGC-Argo Profiling Floats 2.1.1. BGC-Argo Database An array of 105 BGC-Argo profiling floats was deployed in several areas of the world s oceans in the frame of several research programs Organelli et al. 2016a 2017a . BGC-Argo profiling float real-time data are accessible online at ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/ distributed as net CDF data files Wong et al. 2013 and updated daily with new profiles. The quality-controlled database of bio-optical vertical pro- files that supports this work is publicly available from SEANOE SEA scie Ntific Open data Edition publisher Barbieux et al. 2017 . In this database profiles of bbp were eliminated when bathymetry was shallower than 400 m and a signature of bbp at depth was noticeable. This allowed us to remove the data collected in waters where a coastal influence was suspected Black Sea excepted. Hence 8908 BGC-Argo multiparameter profiles or stations corresponding to 91 different BGC-floats collected between 8 November 2012 and 5 January 2016 were used in this study. These stations were grouped into 24 geographic areas Table 1 fol- lowing the bioregions presented in Organelli et al. 2017a except for the Eastern Subtropical Atlantic Gyre that is missing in our database because of suspicious backscattering data from the two profiling floats deployed in this bioregion. Our database includes measurements from a wide range of oceanic conditions from subpolar to tropical waters and from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions Figure 1 . For the purpose of simplifying the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1230 presentation of the results we grouped the different bioregions into five main regimes: 1 the North Atlan- tic Subpolar Gyre NSPG divided in Icelandic Basin Labrador and Irminger Seas 2 the Southern Ocean SO essentially comprising the Indian and the Atlantic sectors 3 the Mediterranean Sea MED that com- prises the Northwestern Basin NW_MED the Southwestern Basin SW_MED the Tyrrhenian Sea TYR_MED the Ionian Sea ION_MED and the Levantine Sea LEV_MED 4 the subtropical regimes STG that include subtropical oligotrophic waters from the North and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Red Sea RED_SEA and 5 the Black Sea Table 1 . 2.1.2. Biogeochemical-Argo Sensor Characteristics and Sampling Strategy The PROVOR CTS-4 NKE Marine Electronics Inc. France is a profiling autonomous platform specifically designed in the context of the Remotely Sensed Biogeochemical Cycles in the Ocean rem Ocean and Novel Argo Ocean Observing System NAOS projects. The PROVOR CTS-4 profiling floats used in this study were equipped with a SBE 41 CTD Seabird Inc. USA an OCR-504 SAtlantic Inc. USA multispectral radiometer measuring the Photosynthetically Available Radiation over the 400-700 nm range PAR and an ECO3 Combined Three Channel Sensors WET Labs Inc. USA measuring the fluorescence of chlorophyll a and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter CDOM at excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/695 and 370/460 nm respectively and the angular scattering coefficient of particles b h k measured at 700 nm and an angle of 1248. Measurements were collected during upward casts programmed every 1 2 3 5 or 10 days depending on the mission and scientific objectives. All casts started from the parking depth at 1 000 m at a time that was sufficient for surfacing around local noon. Vertical resolution of acquisition was 10 m between 1 000 and 250 m 1 m between 250 and 10 m and 0.2 m between 10 m and the surface. Raw data electronic counts were transmitted to land each time the floats surfaced through Iridium two-way communication and were converted into desired quantities. Each variable was quality-controlled according to procedures described hereafter and specifically developed for BGC-Argo data Organelli et al. 2016b Schmechtig et al.

Additionally all the casts were checked for data degradation due to biofouling or instrumental drift. 2.2. Bio-Optical Data Processing 2.2.1. Chlorophyll a Concentration After dark counts have been subtracted from the raw signal chlorophyll a fluorescence was first converted into chlorophyll a concentration according to calibration coefficients provided by the manufacturer WET Labs 2016 . Following the procedures described in Schmechtig et al. 2014 the real-time dedicated quality control procedure identified the occurrence of negative spikes adjusted chlorophyll a concentration pro- files for cases of nonzero values at depth and verified the range of measured values according to technical specifications provided by the manufacturer WET Labs 2016 . In order to correct for the effect of the so- called nonphotochemical quenching NPQ decrease in the fluorescence-to-Chl a ratio under high light con- ditions Kiefer et al. 1973 we systematically applied the procedure developed by Xing et al. 2012 . Besides in some bioregions such as subtropical gyres or the Black Sea the chlorophyll a concentration appeared to increase at depth where it should be null. Proctor and Roesler 2010 assigned this behavior to the influence of fluorescence originating from nonalgal matter. Profiles were thus corrected according to Xing et al. 2016 . Finally following the recommendation by Roesler et al. 2017 for Chla measurements from WET Labs ECO fluorometers the calibrated quality-controlled Chla values were divided by a correction factor of 2. The correction factor was deducted from a global comparison of paired HPLC high-performance liquid chromatography and in situ fluorescence Chla data and confirmed by optical proxies of Chla such as light absorption line height Roesler Barnard 2013 or in situ radiometry Xing et al. 2011 . The regional vari- ability of this average correction factor along with its possible uncertainties is fully discussed in Roesler et al. 2017 . We performed a sensitivity analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship to the factor used for cor- recting the fluorescence-based Chla values. We tested the influence of using two sets of regional factors proposed by Roesler et al. 2017 derived either from HPLC analyses or radiometric measurements com- pared to the global factor of 2. Except for the Southern Ocean that appears more sensitive than other regions to the choice of the correction factor our analysis reveals that the regional factors induce minor changes to the bbp-to-Chla relationship. Overall those minor changes have little impact on the Figure 1.

Thereafter our analysis considers Chla values originating from the global cor- rection factor. Details of the sensitivity analysis may be found in electronic supporting information A. 2.2.2. Particulate Backscattering Coefficient We followed the procedure established by Schmechtig et al. 2016 . Backscattering sensors implemented on floats provide the angular scattering coefficient b at 1248 and at 700 nm. The particulate backscattering coefficient was calculated following Boss and Pegau 2001 : bbpð700Þ ðm21Þ5vð124Þ32p3fbð124 700Þ-bswð124 700Þg 1 with b 124 700 m21 sr21 5 slope 3 counts - bbdark where the instrument-specific slope and bbdark are provided by the manufacturer and v 124 is equal to 1.076 Sullivan et al. 2013 . The contribution of pure seawater bsw was removed and computed according to Zhang et al. 2009 . Finally vertical profiles were quality-controlled by verifying the range of measured values according to the technical specifications provided by the manufacturer WET Labs 2016 and remov- ing negative spikes following Briggs et al. 2011 . Remaining spikes were removed by applying a median fil- ter five-point window . 2.2.3. Estimation of Uncertainty in the bbp-to-Chla Ratio The backscattering and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors implemented on floats are all ECO3 sensors WET Labs Inc. . This avoids heterogeneous sources of uncertainties associated with various sensors see e.g. Roes- ler et al. 2017 . In addition the data are calibrated and qualified following the recommended standard BGC- Argo procedure presented in Schmechtig et al. 2016 . A thorough estimation of the uncertainties affecting the different parameters would necessitate an entirely dedicated study which is beyond the scope of the pre- sent one. However an estimation of the average error that may influence our results has been made.

Considering the surface data a median error of 0.11 is obtained and 80 of the data show relative errors lower than 10 Figure 2a . Relative errors larger than 10 appear for the lowest values of bbp 1023 m21 and Chla 1022 mg m23 Figure 2b which corresponds to the clearest waters of the oligotrophic gyres. In addition a sensitivity analysis described in supporting information A indicates that correcting the fluorescence-based Chla values of the database with regional factors compared to a global factor does not significantly affect the distribution of the computed errors in the bbp-to-Chla ratio. 2.3. Derived Variables 2.3.1. Physical and Biogeochemical Layers of the Water Column We consider four different layers of the water column: i the productive layer Morel Berthon 1989 com- prised between the surface and 1.5 Zeu with Zeu corresponding to the euphotic depth which is the depth at which PAR is reduced to 1 of its surface value ii the mixed layer where all properties are expected to be homogenous and that encompasses a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass Brainerd Gregg 1995 Taylor Ferrari 2010 iii the surface layer observable by satellite remote sensing extending from surface to the first optical depth Zpd Gordon Mc Cluney 1975 and iv the deep chlorophyll maximum DCM layer i.e. thickness of the DCM where different processes may lead to a Chla enhancement. Unlike the pro- ductive layer the surface the mixed and the deep chlorophyll maximum layers are considered as homoge- neous layers where the phytoplankton population is expected to be acclimated to the same light and nutrient regimes. The 0-1.5Zeu layer is chosen to estimate the average bbp-to-Chla ratio in the entire enlightened layer of the water column even if it is acknowledged that large variations in this ratio may occur throughout this layer. This average bbp-to-Chla ratio is thereafter used as a reference to which we compare the ratios calculated for the other layers of the water column. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1233 The mixed layer depth MLD was determined using a 0.03 kg m23 density criterion de Boyer Montegut 2004 . The euphotic depth Zeu and the penetration depth Zpd 5 Zeu/4.6 were computed from the BGC- Argo PAR vertical profiles following the procedure described in Organelli et al. 2016b . Values of Zeu and Zpd are available from Organelli et al. 2016a . To study more specifically the dynamics of the bio-optical properties in the DCM layer and because the width of a DCM may fluctuate in space and time we adjusted a Gaussian profile to each vertical profile of Chla of the database that presented a deep Chla maximum and computed the width of this DCM. This parameterizing approach proposed by Lewis et al. 1983 has been widely used to fit vertical profiles of Chla e.g. Morel Berthon 1989 Uitz et al. 2006 such as c z ð Þ5cmaxe2 z2zmax Dz ð Þ 2 3 where c z is the Chla concentration at depth z cmax is the Chla concentration at the depth of the DCM zmax and Dz the unknown is the width of the DCM. In order to retrieve Dz the unknown parameter we performed an optimization of equation 3 with a maxi- mum width set at 50 m so only the profiles with a relatively pronounced DCM are kept. Then we computed the mean Chla and bbp for the layer that represents the thickness of the DCM. Figure 2.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1234 Finally all quality-controlled profiles of Chla and particulate backscattering coefficient were averaged within the different considered layers. 2.3.2. Environmental and Biological Parameters In order to analyze the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship we consider the role of the light condi- tions in the various layers of the water column i.e. the productive mixed surface and DCM layers. The vertical profiles of bbp:Chla and PAR were averaged within each of the four considered layers. For each layer and both variables the median value was computed monthly and regionally i.e. for each regime . For each layer and each regime we determined the maximum observed PAR that was used to normalize the monthly median PAR values of the corresponding layer and regime PARnorm . Ultimately for each layer and each regime the monthly median PARnorm values were classified into four different intervals 0- 0.25 0.25-0.50 0.50-0.75 0.75-1 and the monthly averaged bbp: Chla values were assigned to one of these four PARnorm intervals. Using the method of Uitz et al. 2006 an index of the phytoplankton community composition based on the relative contributions of size classes to total chlorophyll a was also computed from the surface Chla val- ues. We applied this procedure to the surface Chla values from our BGC-Argo database that we further monthly averaged to finally obtain the relative contributions of microphytoplankton to the total chlorophyll a biomass for each bioregion within the 0-Zpd layer. 3. Results 3.1. Overview of the BGC-Argo Database A latitudinal decreasing gradient of surface Chla is observed from the North Subpolar Gyre NSPG and Southern Ocean SO regimes to the subtropical STG regime with a median Chla from 1 mg m23 to 0.05 mg m23 respectively Figure 2a . It is noteworthy that in our data set where the South East Pacific Ocean is not represented the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre SASTG is the most oligotrophic bioregion experiencing the lowest median Chla 0.014 mg m23 and the highest median Zeu 135 m . A west-to-east trophic gradient is observed in the Mediterranean Sea with median surface Chla values of 0.186 and 0.025 mg m23 in the Northwestern Basin and the Levantine Sea respectively Figure 2a . A similar pattern is observed in the surface particulate backscattering coefficient values Figure 2b . Median surface bbp values range between 0.002 m21 in NSPG and 0.0003 m21 in STG regime. In the Mediterra- nean Sea the bbp values vary over 1 order of magnitude with maximum values found in the Northwestern Basin and minimum values in the Levantine Sea. The North Atlantic Transition Zone to Subtropical Equato- rial Atlantic EQNASTZ bioregion exhibits particularly high values of bbp compared to other STG regions Figure 2a . The Zeu values also show a latitudinal gradient Figure 2c with median values of 50 m in NSPG and 125 m in STG regimes. The median MLD shows a significant variability among the 24 bioregions Figure 2d . The distribution of the MLD in the Mediterranean Sea is centered on a low median value of 23 m but very large values 250 m are episodically observed in the Northwestern Mediterranean NW_MED . The deepest mixed layers median value of 98 m are observed in the South Labrador Sea SLAS_NASPG and episodes of extremely deep mixed layers 1 000 m are also recorded in the Labrador Sea LAS_NASPG . The shallowest mixed layers are observed in the Black Sea 20 m . It is also worth to notice that MLD values in STG are particularly stable and feature very few outliers. 3.2. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship at the Global Scale Within Distinct Layers of the Water Column 3.2.1. The Productive Layer In this layer the bbp-to-Chla relationship follows a power law R2 5 0.74 Figure 3a . Yet when data from dif- ferent regimes and bioregions are considered separately regional and seasonal patterns emerge. Bioregions of the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes Figures 4a-4i show a significant correlation between Chla and bbp with high R2 0.60 and slope i.e. exponent of the power law always above 0.50 except for the Norwe- gian Sea Figure 4a . Minimal values of both Chla and bbp are encountered in winter whereas maximal val- ues are reached in summer. Deviations from the global log-log linear model occur in some bioregions of the NSPG regime e.g. in the Icelandic Basin ICB_NASPG in summer Figure 4b and are characterized by an abnormally high bbp signal considering the observed Chla levels. Such a deviation is found all year long in the Black Sea where a correlation between Chla and bbp is no longer observable R2 5 0.09 Figure 4x . Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1235 In the Mediterranean Sea the slope and R2 decrease from the Northwestern Basin NW_MED Figure 4j to the Levantine Sea LEV_MED Figure 4n where Chla appears to be decoupled from bbp. In the Mediterra- nean Sea a seasonal pattern is noticeable principally in the NW_MED where the highest values of Chla and bbp are found in spring. Except for the South Atlantic Subtropical Transition Zone SASTZ that displays a steep slope and a high R2 value 0.68 and 0.80 respectively regions from the subtropical regime do not show any significant correlation between Chla and bbp featuring the lowest slope and R2 values of the bbp- to-Chla relationship Figures 4o-4w . This clearly suggests a decoupling between those two properties. In these oligotrophic environments different production regimes are delineated along the vertical axis in the upper and lower part of the euphotic zone. One may expect that the bbp-to-Chla relationship will vary depending on the considered layer. In this perspective we further investigate the behavior of the bio- optical properties in different layers of the water column namely the mixed layer the surface layer and the DCM layer. 3.2.2. The Mixed and Surface Layers The distribution of Chla and bbp data for the surface and mixed layers shows similar patterns Figures 3b and 3c . The distribution in the surface layer shows two distinct trends. With the exception of the Atlantic to Indian Southern Ocean ATOI_SO bioregion that shows an important dispersion of bbp values during sum- mer the data collected in the NSPG and SO regimes and NW_MED bioregions exhibit a clear log-log linear covariation between Chla and bbp associated with slopes above 0.3 and high R2 Figures 5a-5j similarly to what is observed for the productive layer Figures 3a and 4 . In the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes values of bbp and Chla in the 0-Zpd layer reach their maximal values in summer Figures 5a-5i whereas in the NW_MED the highest values are recorded in spring Figure 5j . Data from the subtropical regime STG form a separate cluster where Chla and bbp are decoupled with generally very low R2 values. Chla values Figure 3.

For each plot the black line represents the relationship calculated over the productive layer 0-1.5Zeu while the red line corresponds to the regression model calculated over the considered layer.

Whereas bbp values remain constant all over the seasons a seasonal increase of Chla is observable with noticeable higher winter values Figures 5o-5w . The MED Sea is characterized by a gradual decrease in the Chla and bbp covariation across a longitudinal trophic gradient Figures 5j-5n from the NW_MED slope 5 0.33 R2 5 0.66 to the LEV_MED slope 5 0.15 R2 5 0.21 . The Eastern Mediterranean basin does not feature any spring maximum in Chla and bbp Figures 5m and 5n . However there is a noticeable winter increase in Chla as reported also in the STG regime. Regarding the Black Sea bioregion high values of both variables are observed and no seasonal pattern is noticed Figure 5x consistent with what is observed in the productive layer. Figure 4.

The Deep Chlorophyll Maximum Layer The analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship at the level of the DCM obviously considers only the seasonal or permanent stratified regimes and bioregions where a DCM occurs i.e. the Mediterranean and subtropical regimes. The bbp-to-Chla relationship in the DCM layer gradually deviates from the relationship established in the productive layer considering all bioregions Figure 3d . Chla is systematically higher by a factor 2 Figure 5.

The data points for the produc- tive layer are shown in grey color.

The subset of data from this layer also shows two distinct trends in the bbp-to-Chla relationship for Chla val- ues below or above 0.3 mg m23 Figure 3d . For Chla 0.3 mg m23 a positive correlation between bbp and Chla can be noticed although with a large dispersion of the data around the regression line whereas for Chla 0.3 mg m23 Chla and bbp exhibit a strong decoupling. The MED Sea Figures B1a-B1e in electronic supporting information B is characterized by a stronger covariation between Chla and bbp than the STG regime Figures B1f-B1n in electronic supporting information B R2 5 0.53 for NW_MED versus R2 5 0.10 for SPSTG . In the Mediterranean Sea DCMs are seasonal phenomena occurring essentially in summer or fall e.g. Siokou-Frangou et al. 2010 . A covariation between bbp and Chla occurs as soon as a DCM takes place with maximum values of bbp and Chla encountered in summer when the DCM is the most pronounced in both the western and eastern Mediterranean basins. On the opposite in the STG regime where durable stratification takes place DCMs appear as a permanent pattern. The bbp and Chla variations are decoupled and the highest values of both variables are recorded in spring or fall. 4. Discussion The present analysis of a global BGC-Argo database indicates a general power relationship between bbp and Chla in the productive layer as well as in the surface and mixed layers. Nevertheless the analysis of sub- sets of data suggests a large second-order variability around the global mean relationships depending on the considered range of values in Chla and bbp layer of the water column region or season. In this section we investigate the sources of variability around the average bbp-to-Chla relationship in our database. 4.1. General Relationship Between Chla and bbp The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass Cullen 1982 Siegel et al. 2013 whereas the particulate backscattering coefficient is considered as a proxy of the POC in open ocean Balch et al. 2001 Cetinic et al. 2012 Dall Olmo Mork 2014 Stramski et al. 1999 and provides information on the whole pool of particles not specifically on phototrophic organisms. Over broad biomass gradients the stock of POC covaries with phytoplankton biomass and hence bbp and Chla show substantial covariation. This is what is observed in the present study when the full database is considered Figure 3a . This is also the case when we examine subsets of data from the NSPG and SO regimes that feature strong seasonality and show relatively constant relationships between bbp and Chla Figures 3a-3c 4a-4I and 5a-5i . In such environments an increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a is associated with an increase in bbp. Such significant relationships between bbp and Chla have indeed been reported in several studies based on relatively large data sets Huot et al. 2008 or measurements from seasonally dynamic systems Antoine et al. 2011 Stramska et al. 2003 Xing et al. 2014 . Our results corroborate these studies and yield a global relationship of the form bbp 700 5 0.00181 60.000001 Chla0.605 60.005 for the productive layer. Nevertheless the bbp-to-Chla relationship is largely variable depending on the considered layer of the water column. Regarding the mixed and surface layers our study suggests a general relationship with determina- tion coefficients smaller than those calculated for the productive layer. The intercept 0.0017 and more importantly the slope values 0.36 associated with the surface layer are also lower than those associated with the productive layer Table 3 hence for a given level of bbp the Chla is lower for the surface layer than predicted by the productive layer relationship. Empirical relationships of the literature previously established in various regions in the first few meters of the water column Antoine et al. 2011 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 Reynolds et al. 2001 Xing et al. 2014 always show steeper slope compared to our results for the surface layer Table 2 . To our knowledge the present study proposes the first analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship within the DCM layer. A significant relationship between bbp and Chla is observed and it is associated with the steep- est slope the highest RMSE and the lowest coefficient of determination in comparison with the other layers Table 3 . Thus for the DCM layer a given level of bbp is associated with higher values of Chla than pre- dicted by the global relationship of the productive layer. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1239 In the next two sections we will investigate the underlying processes leading to the existence or not of a relationship between bbp and Chla and explore the variability of this relationship along the vertical dimen- sion the seasons and the distinct bioregions of the different regimes. For this purpose we will consider the behavior of the bbp:Chla ratio with respect to light conditions and phytoplankton community composition. 4.2. Influence of the Nature of the Particulate Assemblage on the bbp-to-Chla Relationship Although the relationship between POC and bbp is evident in some regions the particulate backscattering coefficient is not a direct proxy of POC. It depends on several parameters such as the concentration of par- ticles in the water column their size distribution shape structure and refractive index Babin Morel 2003 Huot et al. 2007 Morel Bricaud 1986 Whitmire et al. 2010 . The bbp coefficient has been shown to be very sensitive to the presence of picophytoplankton as well as of nonalgal particles of the submicron size range e.g. detritus bacteria and viruses especially in oligotrophic waters Ahn et al. 1992 Stramski et al. 2001 Vaillancourt et al. 2004 but also to particles up to 10 mm Loisel et al. 2007 . In regions with substantial inputs of mineral particles a shift toward enhanced bbp values for a constant Chla level occurs Figures 4w and 4x 5w and 5x . Substantial concentrations of mineral particles submi- crometer particles of Saharan origin for example have been shown to cause significant increases in the par- ticulate backscattering signal Claustre et al. 2002 Loisel et al. 2011 Prospero 1996 Stramski et al. 2004 . The EQNASTZ bioregion exhibits for example particularly high bbp values compared to the low Chla found in the surface layer Figures 4w and 5w . This is not surprising considering that this region is located in the Equatorial North Atlantic dust belt Kaufman et al. 2005 . The Black Sea is also characterized by a higher bbp signal than predicted from Chla based on our global model Figures 4x and 5x . This could be explained by the fact that this enclosed sea follows a coastal trophic regime and is strongly influenced by river runoff that may carry small and highly refractive lithogenic particles Ludwig et al. 2009 Tanhua et al. 2013 . Such an increase in backscattering signal may also be related to coccolithophorid blooms Balch et al. 1996a . These small calcifying microalgae highly backscatter light due to their calcium carbonate shell and their presence could explain the episodically higher bbp than predicted by the global regression model Table 2 Empirical Relationship Between the Particulate Backscattering Coefficient bbp and the Concentration Of Chlorophyll a Chl a Previously Published in the Literature With the Corresponding Reference and Abbreviation Region and Layer of the Water Column Considered for Analysis Empirical relationship Region Layer in the water column Abbreviation Reference bbp k 5 0.0023 - 0.000005 k - 550 Chla0.565 1 0.000486 k-550 Eastern South Pacific 2/Kd 490 H08 Huot et al. 2008 bbp 555 5 0.004 Chla0.822 Antarctic Polar Front 15 m R0l a Reynolds et al. 2001 bbp 555 5 0.001 Chla0.667 Ross Sea 15 m R0l b Reynolds et al. 2001 bbp 555 5 0.0019 Chla0.61 Polar North Atlantic MLD S03 Stramska et al. 2003 bbp 526 5 0.00386 Chla Eastern Equatorial Pacific Surface Dall09 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 modified in Xing et al. 2014 bbp 532 5 0.003 Chla0.786 North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre Zpd X14 Xing et al. 2014 bbp 555 5 0.00197 Chla0.647 North-Western Mediterranean Sea and Santa Barbara Channel Surface All Antoine et al. 2011 Table 3 Empirical Relationship Obtained Between the Particulate Backscattering Coefficient bbp and the Concentration of Chlorophyll a Chl a for the Different Layers of the Water Column Considered in This Study Empirical relationship Water column layer R2 RMSE Number of data bbp 700 5 0.00174 Chla0.360 0-Zpd 0.6311 0.000942 5 253 bbp 700 5 0.00171 Chla0.373 0-MLD 0.6167 0.000932 8 743 bbp 700 5 0.00147 Chla0.753 DCM 0.5667 0.00104 1 628 bbp 700 5 0.00181 Chla0.605 021.5Zeu 0.7443 0.000967 5 250 Note.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1240 particularly in the Black Sea where coccolithophorid blooms are frequently reported Cokacar et al. 2001 Kopelevich et al. 2014 or in the Iceland Basin Balch et al. 1996b Holligan et al. 1993 Figure 4b or 5b . Recently the bbp:Chla ratio proxy of the POC:Chla ratio Alvarez et al. 2016 Behrenfeld et al. 2015 West- berry et al. 2016 has been used as an optical index of phytoplankton communities with low values associ- ated with a dominance of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage Cetinic et al. 2012 2015 . Indeed in open ocean waters phytoplankton generally dominate the pool of particles in the water column. A shift toward higher or weaker bbp values at a constant Chla level may be explained by changes in the phyto- plankton community composition. However in oligotrophic environments nonalgal particles may represent a significant part of the particulate assemblage Loisel et al. 2007 Stramski et al. 2004 Yentsch Phinney 1989 . Indeed a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or even non- living particles including detritus or inorganic particles could influence the bbp:Chla ratio e.g. Claustre et al. 1999 Morel Ahn 1991 Stramski et al. 2001 . The lowest bbp:Chla values in our global database occur in summer in the NSPG and SO regimes Figures 6a-6i and are associated with large contributions 40 of microphytoplankton to the total Chla. This actually corroborates the hypothesis of Cetinic et al. 2012 2015 that bbp:Chla can be considered as an opti- cal index of the phytoplankton community composition. High values of the bbp:Chla ratio are associated with large contributions of picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to algal biomass and low values with diatom-dominated communities. The occurrence of microphytoplankton blooms of large-sized Figure 6. Monthly climatology of the bbp:Chla ratio within the surface layer 0-Zpd . The color code indicates the fractional contribution of the microphytoplankton to the chlorophyll biomass associated with the entire phytoplankton assemblage estimated from the Uitz et al. 2006 parameterization. In each figure the horizontal black line shows the minimum value of the bbp:Chla ratio determined within each bioregion. The black lines represent the standard deviation for each data point. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1241 phytoplankton community is indeed well known in the NSPG regime Barton et al. 2015 Cetinic et al. 2015 Li 2002 or in some productive regions of the Southern Ocean Georges et al. 2014 Mendes et al. 2015 Uitz et al. 2009 . Similarly in the NW_MED bioregion low bbp:Chla values are accompanied by large contri- butions of microphytoplankton during the spring bloom Marty Chiaverini 2010 Mayot et al. 2016 Siokou-Frangou et al. 2010 . On the opposite high bbp:Chla values in summer are rather associated with dominant contributions of the picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to the total chlorophyll biomass Figure 6j and also possibly to a higher proportion of nonalgal particles consistently with Navarro et al. 2014 or Sammartino et al. 2015 . In the rest of the Mediterranean Basin SW_MED TYR_MED and the Eastern Basin Figures 6k-6n as well as in the subtropical regime the phytoplankton biomass is essentially constant throughout the year with high bbp:Chla values in summer lower values in winter and a relatively constant picoplankton-dominated algal community Figures 6o-6w Dandonneau et al. 2004 Ras et al. 2008 Uitz et al. 2006 . In this region the seasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio does not seem to be influenced at a first order by changes in phyto- plankton community composition. 4.3. Influence of Photoacclimation on the bbp-to-Chla Relationship The Chla is an imperfect proxy of phytoplankton biomass that varies not only with phytoplankton carbon biomass but also with environmental conditions such as light temperature or nutrient availability Babin et al. 1996 Cleveland et al. 1989 Geider et al. 1997 . Phytoplankton cells adjust their intracellular Chla in response to changes in light conditions through the process of photoacclimation Dubinsky Stambler 2009 Eisner et al. 2003 Falkowski Laroche 1991 Lindley et al. 1995 . Photoacclimation-induced varia- tions in intracellular Chla may cause large changes in the Chla-to-carbon ratio Behrenfeld et al. 2005 Geider 1987 Sathyendranath et al. 2009 and thus changes in the bbp-to-Chla ratio Behrenfeld Boss 2003 Siegel et al. 2005 . In the upper oceanic layer of the water column photoacclimation to high light may result in an increase in the bbp-to-Chla ratio whereas a decrease in this ratio occurs in DCM layers or in the upper layer during winter time in subpolar regimes NSPG and SO where photoacclimation to low light occurs. The impact of light conditions on the bbp:Chla ratio in the different regimes is illustrated in Figure 7. Signifi- cant trends are observed in the different layers of the water column for all regimes except for the Black Sea. In the NSPG and SO regimes the bbp:Chla ratio remains relatively constant with respect to the normalized PAR regardless of the considered layer of the water column Figures 7a-7c . In contrast the Mediterranean Sea and the subtropical gyres show a decoupling between bbp and Chla Figures 5k-5w so the bbp:Chla ratio in the productive mixed or surface layer increases with an increase in the normalized PAR Figures 7a- 7c . The seasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio in these regimes results from variations in Chla whereas bbp remains relatively constant over the seasons not shown . Thus our results suggest that the variability in the bbp:Chla ratio in the NSPG and SO regimes is not driven at first order by phytoplankton acclimation to light level even if such a process is known to occur at shorter temporal and spatial scales in those regimes Beh- renfeld et al. 2015 Lutz et al. 2003 . On the opposite in both the MED and STG regimes the bbp:Chla ratio variations are essentially driven by phytoplankton photoacclimation. In these oligotrophic regimes Chla within the DCM layer is at least a factor of 2 higher than in the produc- tive layer Figure 6 . In the lower part of the euphotic zone phytoplankton cells hence adjust their intracellu- lar Chla to low light conditions resulting in a decrease in the bbp:Chla ratio. In addition the bbp:Chla ratio in this layer seems to remain constant within a regime regardless of absolute light conditions Figure 7d . Actually the absolute values of PAR essentially vary between 10 and 25 mmol quanta m22 s21 in all the bio- regions along the year with values exceeding 50 mmol quanta m22 s21 only in the NW_MED and EQNASTZ bioregions. As reported by Letelier et al. 2004 and Mignot et al. 2014 the DCM may follow a given iso- lume along the seasonal cycle and is thus essentially light driven. Finally we suggest that the relative homo- geneity of both the environmental PAR conditions and phytoplankton community composition at the DCM level in subtropical regimes may explain the relative stability of the bbp:Chla values in this water col- umn layer. In the Mediterranean Sea in contrast some studies evoke changes in phytoplankton communi- ties in the DCM layer Crombet et al. 2011 suggesting our results might be further explored when relevant data are available. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2017JC013030 BARBIEUX ET AL. 1242 4.4. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship Is Driven by a Combination of Factors In the previous sections we examined the processes that potentially drive the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship in the various oceanic regimes considered here. In the subpolar regimes NSPG and SO changes in the composition of the particle assemblage phytoplank- ton communities in particular are likely the first-order driver of the seasonal variability in the bbp-to-Chla ratio Figure 8 . In these regimes the bbp:Chla ratio remains constant regardless of the light intensity in both the productive and surface layers suggesting that phytoplankton photoacclimation is likely not an important driver of the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship. We note however that in the SO other factors may come into play such as the light-mixing regime or iron limitation e.g. Blain et al. 2007 2013 Boyd 2002 . On the opposite in the subtropical regime Chla and bbp are decoupled in the surface layer as well as in the DCM layer. Thus photoacclimation seems to be the main process driving the vertical and sea- sonal variability of the bbp-to-Chla relationship although a varying contribution of nonalgal particles to the particle pool cannot be excluded. Whereas the subpolar and the subtropical regimes behave as a biomass regime and a photoacclimation regime sensu Siegel et al. 2005 respectively the Mediterranean Sea stands as an intermediate regime between these two end-members. The large number of data available in the Mediterranean allows us to describe this intermediate situation Figure 8 . The Mediterranean Sea appears as a more complex and vari- able system than the stable and resilient subtropical gyres. Along with the ongoing development of the global BGC-Argo program and associated float deployments additional data collected in underrepresented regions will become available to make our database more robust and will help to improve our analysis. In the surface layer of the Mediterranean system a high bbp:Chla ratio in summer might be attributed not only to i a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or large contribution of nonliving particles including detritus or inorganic particles Bricaud et al. 2004 Claustre et al. 1999 Figure 7.

Following the longitudinal trophic gradient of the Mediterranean Sea we observe a variation in the biogeo- chemical status of the DCM Figures 1a-d in Supporting information A . The DCM may be attributed to low light photoacclimation similarly to the DCM observed in the STG regime. Yet under favorable light and nutrient conditions encountered in the Western Mediterranean basin the DCM could result from a real bio- mass increase occurring at depth instead of a simple photoacclimation artifact Beckmann Hense 2007 Cullen 2014 Mignot et al. 2014 Winn et al. 1995 . In such conditions referred to as deep biomass maxi- mum DBM a concurrent increase in Chla and POC associated with large phytoplankton cells leads to con- stantly low values of the bbp:Chla ratio Figure 7d . Our results corroborate previous studies Crombet et al. 2011 Latasa et al. 1992 Mignot et al. 2014 about the seasonal occurrence of a DBM in the Western Basin of Mediterranean Sea. This deep feature could actually represent a significant source of phytoplankton car- bon biomass that is ignored by satellite ocean color sensors that only probe the surface layer of the water column.

Conclusions The main goal of the present study was to examine the variability of the relationship between the particu- late backscattering coefficient and the chlorophyll a concentration over a broad range of oceanic condi- tions. Using an extensive BGC-Argo profiling float database we investigated the sources of variability in this relationship with respect to the vertical dimension as well as on a seasonal and regional scale. In accordance with previous studies Antoine et al. 2011 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 Huot et al. 2008 Reynolds et al. 2001 Stramska et al. 2003 Xing et al. 2014 and consistently with the so-called bio-optical assumption Siegel et al. 2005 Smith Baker 1978b a general covariation between bbp and Chla is observed at a global scale in the productive layer of the water column 0-1.5Zeu . Although this covariation seems to be permanent in subpolar regimes in relation with large-amplitude phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles Boss Behren- feld 2010 Henson et al. 2006 Lacour et al. 2015 several nuances have been revealed according to the season considered layer of the water column and bioregion. We suggest that the bbp:Chla ratio proxy of the C:Chla ratio Behrenfeld et al. 2015 Westberry et al. 2016 can be used either as an index of the nature composition and size of the particle assemblage in a biomass regime NSPG and SO regimes and West- ern Mediterranean basin or as a photophysiological index in a photoacclimation regime STG regime and Eastern Mediterranean basin . The present analysis provides insights into the coupling between major proxies of the POC and phytoplank- ton biomass in key regimes encountered in the world s open oceans. It points to the strong potential of the recently available global BGC-Argo float database to address regional or seasonal nuances in first-order rela- tionships that have been established in the past on admittedly restricted data sets. In addition this study stresses out the large variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship which is critical to the bio-optical modeling of the bbp coefficient in several semiempirical ocean color models Garver Siegel 1997 Lee et al. 2002 Maritorena et al. 2002 . Indeed bio-optical and reflectance models require detailed knowledge and param- eterization of the average trends in the inherent optical properties especially in open ocean waters where these trends can be related to Chla. Although the analysis of the impact of such variability on ocean color modeling is out of the scope of the present paper we expect our analysis to be potentially useful in the context of applications to ocean color. Finally as the amount of BGC-float data will continue to increase it will be possible to reassess the variability of bio-optical relationships and to establish new global stand- ards and regional parameterizations.

INTRODUCTION Our ability to observe the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and associated carbon fluxes on relevant space and time scales considerably limits our understanding and prediction skills of the biogeochemical role of phytoplankton in the carbon biological pump Volk and Hoffert 1985 Honjo et al. 2014 Legendre et al. 2015 . For example in situ measurements of primary production and phytoplankton carbon biomass are particularly challenging and remain scarce although novel promising techniques have been recently proposed Riser and Johnson 2008 Graff et al. 2012 Graff et al. 2015 . To overcome space-time coverage sampling limitations bio-optical oceanographers have implemented optical sensors on a variety of in situ or remote platforms from research vessels and moorings to ocean color satellites gliders and profiling floats each with specific complementary space-time observation scales Dickey 2003 Claustre et al. 2010 . Such platforms enable to monitor bio-optical properties that serve as proxies for major biogeochemical variables. Those include the concentration of chlorophyll a Chla and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 700 nm hereafter referred simply as b bp . The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass Cullen 1982 Siegel et al. 2013 although it is well known that the ratio of Chla to carbon shows large fluctuations driven by a variety of factors such as phytoplankton physiology Geider 1993 Staehr et al. 2002 Álvarez et al. 2016 or community composition Geider et al. 1997 Mac Intyre et al. 2002 Halsey and Jones 2015 . In the absence of mineral particles i.e. in most open-ocean waters b bp generally covaries with and is therefore used as a proxy of the stock of particulate organic carbon POC Stramski et al. 1999 Loisel et al. 2002 Bishop 2009 . However changes in the nature composition and size of the particle assemblage may cause large variability in the b bp signal and in the POC-to-b bp relationship Flory et al. 2004 Gardner et al. 2006 Stramski et al. 2008 Bishop 2009 . Examining bio-optical relationships which for example link the inherent optical properties of particles such as absorption or scattering to Chla has long been an area of active research in bio-optical oceanography Smith and Baker 1978a Mitchell and Holm-Hansen 1991 Mitchell 1992 Bricaud et al. 1995 Morel et al. 2007b Szeto et al. 2011 Huot and Antoine 2016 Organelli et al. 2017a . Among different types of applications bio-optical relationships enable deriving biogeochemical information over a broad range of space and time scales from in situ or remote optical measurements Loisel et al. 2002 Siegel et al. 2005 Huot et al. 2007b . Such relationships are also used in semi-analytical inverse models to interpret remote sensing ocean color data Gordon et al. 1988 Loisel and Morel 1998 Morel and Maritorena 2001 . Various studies focused on the relationship between Chla and b bp using data from ocean color remote sensing Reynolds et al. 2001 Stramska et al. 2003 field cruises Huot et al. 2008 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 fixed mooring Antoine et al. 2011 or Biogeochemical-Argo BGC-Argo profiling floats Xing et al. 2014 . All of these studies confirmed the principle of the bio-optical assumption Smith and Baker 1978b Siegel et al. 2005 suggesting that in open-ocean waters the optical properties of a water mass co-vary to a first order with Chla. Yet depending on the considered data set previous studies also indicate large second-order variability around the mean b bp vs. Chla power-law relationship Brown et al. 2008 Huot et al. 2008 Xing et al. 2014 . Restricted to a given period of time region or trophic regime and mainly to the surface layer of the water column these studies did not lead to a thorough characterization of the variability in the relationship between Chla and b bp over the full range of environments encountered in the open ocean. In addition these studies involved different methodologies for b bp measurements or retrievals so that it is difficult to untangle regional and/or seasonal variability from possible methodological biases Sullivan et al. 2013 . The recently launched network of BGC-Argo profiling floats is progressively transforming our capability to observe optical properties and biogeochemical processes in the oceans Claustre et al. 2010 IOCCG 2011 Biogeochemical-Argo Planning Group 2016 Johnson and Claustre 2016 . The current BGC-Argo bio-optical database has drastically increased over recent years and now encompasses observations collected in a broad range of hydrological trophic and bio-optical conditions encountered in the world s open oceans Organelli et al. 2017a Organelli et al. 2017b . Based on homogeneous measurements and processing methodologies this database offers a unique opportunity to comprehensively reassess biooptical relationships. Based on the analysis of more than 8500 multi-variable profiles collected within the water column 0-1000 m by BGC-Argo floats this study aims to i investigate the natural variability around the mean statistical b bp -to-Chla relationship at the vertical regional and seasonal scales and ii identify the underlying sources of variability. DATA AND METHODS BGC-Argo profiling floats BGC-Argo database An array of 105 BGC-Argo profiling floats was deployed in several areas of the world s oceans in the frame of several research programs Organelli et al. 2016a Organelli et al. 2017a Open data Edition publisher Barbieux et al. 2017 . In this database profiles of b bp were eliminated when bathymetry was shallower than 400 m and a signature of b bp at depth was noticeable. This allowed us to remove the data collected in waters where a coastal influence was suspected Black Sea excepted. Hence 8908 BGC-Argo multi-parameter profiles or stations corresponding to 91 different BGC-floats collected between November 8 2012 and January 5 2016 were used in this study. These stations were grouped into 24 geographic areas Table 1 following the bioregions presented in Organelli et al. 2017a except for the Eastern Subtropical Atlantic Gyre that is missing in our database because of suspicious backscattering data from the two profiling floats deployed in this bioregion. In this paper we show the graphs and data for each of these 24 bioregions so that each reader can evaluate the variability in the b bp :Chla ratio for any specific region of interest. Our database includes measurements from a wide range of oceanic conditions from subpolar to tropical waters and from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions Fig. 1 . For the purpose of simplifying the presentation of the results we grouped the different bioregions into five main m between 1000 m and 250 m 1 m between 250 m and 10 m and 0.2 m between 10 m and the surface Organelli et al. 2016a . Raw data electronic counts were transmitted to land each time the floats surfaced through Iridium two-way communication and were converted into desired quantities. Each variable was quality-controlled according to procedures described hereafter and specifically developed for BGC-Argo data Schmechtig et al. 2014 Schmechtig et al. 2016 Organelli et al. 2016b . Additionally all the casts were checked for data degradation due to bio-fouling or instrumental drift. Labs 2016 . In order to correct for the effect of the socalled non-photochemical quenching NPQ decrease in the fluorescence-to-Chla ratio under high light conditions Kiefer et al. 1973 we systematically applied the procedure developed by Xing et al. 2012 . Besides in some bioregions such as subtropical gyres or the Black Sea the chlorophyll a concentration appeared to increase at depth where it should be null. Proctor and Roesler 2010 assigned this behavior to the influence of fluorescence originating from non-algal matter. Profiles were thus corrected according to Xing et al. 2016 . Finally following the recommendation by Roesler et al. 2017 for Chla measurements from WET Labs ECO fluorometers the calibrated quality-controlled Chla values were divided by a correction factor of 2. The correction factor was deducted from a global comparison of paired HPLC High Performance Liquid Chromatography and in situ fluorescence Chla data and confirmed by optical proxies of Chla such as light absorption line height Roesler and Barnard 2013 or in situ radiometry Xing et al. 2011 . The regional variability of this average correction factor along with its possible uncertainties is fully discussed in Roesler et al. 2017 . We performed a sensitivity analysis of the b bp -to-Chla relationship to the factor used for correcting the fluorescence-based Chla values. We tested the influence of using two sets of regional factors proposed by Roesler et al. 2017 derived either from HPLC analyses or radiometric measurements compared to the global factor of 2. Except for the Southern Ocean that appears more sensitive than other regions to the choice of the correction factor our analysis reveals that the regional factors induce minor changes to the b bp -to-Chla relationship. Bio Overall those minor changes have little impact on the interpretation of our results. Thereafter our analysis considers Chla values originating from the global correction factor. Details of the sensitivity analysis may be found in supporting information SA presented as electronic supplementary material. Particulate backscattering coefficient We followed the procedure established by Schmechtig et al. 2016 . Backscattering sensors implemented on floats provide the angular scattering coefficient β at 124 and at 700 nm. The particulate backscattering coefficient was calculated following Boss and Pegau 2001 : b bp 700 m -1 x 2 x β 124 700 - 1 with β 124 700 m -1 sr -1 slope x counts -b b dark where the instrument-specific slope and b b dark are provided by the manufacturer and is equal to 1.076 Sullivan et al. 2013 . The contribution of pure seawater was removed in order to take into account the effect of the temperature and salinity and was computed according to Zhang et al. 2009 . Finally vertical profiles were quality-controlled by verifying the range of measured values according to the technical specifications provided by the manufacturer WET Labs 2016 and removing negative spikes following Briggs et al. 2011 . Remaining spikes were removed by applying a median filter 5-point window . Estimation of uncertainty in the b bp -to-Chla ratio The backscattering and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors implemented on floats are all ECO3 sensors WET Labs Inc. . This avoids heterogeneous sources of uncertainties associated with various sensors see e.g. Roesler et al. 2017 . In addition the data are calibrated and qualified following the recommended standard BGC-Argo procedure presented in Schmechtig et al. 2016 . A thorough estimation of the uncertainties affecting the different parameters would necessitate an entirely dedicated study which is beyond the scope of the present one. However an estimation of the average error that may influence our results has been made. Accounting for measurement error only we assume an error for the b bp sensor and for the chlorophyll fluorescence sensor as provided by the manufacturer. Following an error propagation law Birge 1939 Ku 1966 the combined effect of these errors on the b bp -to-Chla ratio can be computed and a relative error in can be obtained as: 2 Considering the surface data a median error of 0.11 is obtained and 80 of the data show relative errors lower than 10 Fig. 2a . Relative errors larger than 10 appear for the lowest values of b bp 10 -3 m -1 and Chla 10 -2 mg m-3 Fig. 2b which corresponds to the clearest waters of the oligotrophic gyres. In addition a sensitivity analysis described in supporting information SA indicates that correcting the fluorescence-based Chla values of the database with regional factors compared to a global factor does not significantly affect the distribution of the computed errors in the b bp -to-Chla ratio see electronic auxiliary material . Derived variables Physical and biogeochemical layers of the water column We consider four different layers of the water column: i the productive layer Morel and Berthon 1989 comprised between the surface and 1.5 Z eu with Z eu corresponding to the euphotic depth which is the depth at which PAR is reduced to 1 of its surface value ii the mixed layer where all properties are expected to be homogenous and that encompasses a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass Brainerd and Gregg 1995 Taylor and Ferrari 2010 iii the surface layer observable by satellite remote sensing extending from surface to the first optical depth Z pd Gordon and Mc Cluney 1975 and iv the deep chlorophyll maximum DCM layer i.e. thickness of the DCM where different processes may lead to a Chla enhancement. Unlike the productive layer the surface the mixed and the deep chlorophyll maximum layers are considered as homogeneous layers where the phytoplankton population is expected to be acclimated to the same light and nutrient regimes. The 0-1.5 Z eu layer is chosen to estimate the average b bp -to-Chla ratio in the entire enlightened layer of the water column even if it is acknowledged that large variations in this ratio may occur throughout this layer. This average b bp -to-Chla ratio is thereafter used as a reference to which we compare the ratios calculated for the other layers of the water column. The Mixed layer depth MLD was determined using a 0.03 kg m -3 density criterion de Boyer Montégut 2004 . The euphotic depth Z eu and the penetration depth Z pd Z eu /4.6 were computed from the BGC-Argo PAR vertical profiles following the procedure described in Organelli et al. 2016b . Values of Z eu and Z pd are available from Organelli et al. 2016a . To study more specifically the dynamics of the bio-optical properties in the DCM layer and because the width of a DCM may fluctuate in space and time we adjusted a Gaussian profile to each vertical profile of Chla of the database that presented a deep Chla maximum and computed the width of this DCM. This parameterizing approach proposed by Lewis et al. 1983 has been widely used to fit vertical profiles of Chla e.g. Morel and Berthon 1989 Uitz et al. 2006 such as: 2 where c z is the Chla concentration at depth z c max is the Chla concentration at the depth of the DCM z max and z the unknown is the width of the DCM. In order to retrieve the unknown parameter we performed an optimization of Eq. 2 with a maximum width set at 50 m so only the profiles with a relatively pronounced DCM are kept. Then we computed the mean Chla and b bp for the layer that represents the thickness of the DCM. Finally all quality-controlled profiles of Chla and particulate backscattering coefficient were averaged within the different considered layers. Environmental and biological parameters In Using the method of Uitz et al. 2006 an index of the phytoplankton community composition based on the relative contributions of size classes to total chlorophyll a was also computed from the surface Chla values. We applied this procedure to the surface Chla values from our BGC-Argo database that we further monthly averaged to finally obtain the relative contributions of micro- nano-and picophytoplankton to the total chlorophyll a biomass for each bioregion within the 0-Z pd layer. RESULTS Overview of the BGC-Argo database A latitudinal decreasing gradient of surface Chla is observed from the North Subpolar Gyre NSPG and Southern Ocean SO regimes to the subtropical STG regime with a median Chla from 1 mg m -3 to 0.05 mg m -3 respectively Fig. 2a . It is noteworthy that in our dataset where the South East Pacific Ocean is not represented the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre SASTG is the most oligotrophic bioregion experiencing the lowest median Chla 0.014 mg m -3 and the highest median Z eu 135 m . A west-to-east trophic gradient is observed in the Mediterranean Sea with median surface Chla values of 0.186 mg m -3 and 0.025 mg m -3 in the Northwestern Basin and the Levantine Sea respectively Fig. 2a . Variability in the b bp -to-Chla relationship at the global scale within distinct layers of the water column The productive layer 3.2.1 In this layer the b bp -to-Chla relationship follows a power law R 2 0.74 Fig. 3a . Yet when data from different regimes and bioregions are considered separately regional and seasonal patterns emerge. Bioregions of the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes Figs. 4a-i show a significant correlation between Chla and b bp with high R 2 0.60 and slope i.e. exponent of the power law always above 0.50 except for the Norwegian Sea Fig. 4a . Minimal values of both Chla and b bp are encountered in winter whereas maximal values are reached in summer. Deviations from the global log-log linear model occur in some bioregions of the NSPG regime e.g. in the Icelandic Basin ICB_NASPG in summer Fig. 4b and are characterized by an abnormally high b bp signal considering the observed Chla levels. Such a deviation is found all year long in the Black Sea where a correlation between Chla and b bp is no longer observable R 2 0.09 Fig. 4x . In the Mediterranean Sea the slope and R 2 decrease from the Northwestern Basin NW_MED Fig. 4j to the Levantine Sea LEV_MED Fig. 4n where Chla appears to be decoupled from b bp . In the Mediterranean Sea a seasonal pattern is noticeable principally in the NW_MED where the highest values of Chla and b bp are found in spring. Except for the South Atlantic Subtropical Transition Zone SASTZ that displays a steep slope and a high R 2 value 0.68 and 0.80 respectively regions from the subtropical regime do not show any significant correlation between Chla and b bp featuring the lowest slope and R 2 values of the b bp -to-Chla relationship Figs. 4o-w . This clearly suggests a decoupling between those two properties. In these oligotrophic environments different production regimes are delineated along the vertical axis in the upper and lower part of the euphotic zone. One may expect that the b bp -to-Chla relationship will vary depending on the considered layer. In this perspective we further investigate the behavior of the bio-optical properties in different layers of the water column namely the mixed layer the surface layer and the DCM layer. The subset of data from this layer also shows two distinct trends in the b bp -to-Chla relationship for Chla values below or above 0.3 mg m -3 Fig. 3d . For Chla 0.3 mg m -3 a positive correlation between b bp and Chla can be noticed although with a large dispersion of the data around the regression line whereas for Chla 0.3 mg m -3 Chla and b bp exhibit a strong decoupling. The MED Sea Figs. SB1a-e is characterized by a stronger covariation between Chla and b bp than the STG regime Figs. SB1g-n R 2 0.53 for NW_MED versus R 2 0.10 for SPSTG . In the Mediterranean Sea DCMs are seasonal phenomena occurring essentially in summer or fall e.g. Siokou-Frangou et al. 2010 . A covariation between b bp and Chla occurs as soon as a DCM takes place with maximum values of b bp and Chla encountered in summer when the DCM is the most pronounced in both the western and eastern Mediterranean basins Figs. SB1a-e . On the opposite in the STG regime where durable stratification takes place DCMs appear as a permanent pattern. The b bp and Chla variations are decoupled and the highest values of both variables are recorded in spring or fall Figs. SB1f-n . DISCUSSION The present analysis of a global BGC-Argo database indicates a general power linear relationship between b bp and Chla in the productive layer as well as in the surface and mixed layers. Nevertheless the analysis of subsets of data suggests a large second-order variability around the global mean relationships depending on the considered range of values in Chla and b bp layer of the water column region or season. In this section we investigate the sources of variability around the average b bp -to-Chla relationship in our database. General relationship between Chla and b bp The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass Cullen 1982 Siegel et al. 2013 whereas the particulate backscattering coefficient is considered as a proxy of the POC in open ocean Stramski et al. 1999 Balch et al. 2001 Cetinić et al. 2012 Dall Olmo and Mork 2014 and provides information on the whole pool of particles not specifically on phototrophic organisms. Over broad biomass gradients the stock of POC covaries with phytoplankton biomass and hence b bp and Chla show substantial covariation. This is what is observed in the present study when the full database is considered Fig. 3a . This is also the case when we examine subsets of data from the NSPG and SO regimes which although featuring strong seasonality showing relatively constant relationships between b bp and Chla Figs. 3a-c 4a-i and 5a-i . In such environments an increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a is associated with an increase in b bp . Such significant relationships between b bp and Chla have indeed been reported in several studies based on relatively large datasets Huot et al. 2008 or measurements from seasonally dynamic systems Stramska et al. 2003 Antoine et al. 2011 Xing et al. 2014 . Our results corroborate these studies and yield a global relationship of the form b bp 700 0.00181 0.000014 Chla 0.605 0.00484 for the productive layer. Nevertheless the b bp -to-Chla relationship is largely variable depending on the considered layer of the water column. Regarding the mixed and surface layers our study suggests a general relationship with determination coefficients smaller than those calculated for the productive layer. The intercept 0.0017 and more importantly the slope values 0.36 associated with the surface layer are also lower than those associated with the productive layer Table 3 hence for a given level of b bp the Chla is lower for the surface layer than predicted by the productive layer relationship. Empirical relationships of the literature previously established in various regions in the first few meters of the water column Reynolds et al. 2001 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 Antoine et al. 2011 Xing et al. 2014 always show steeper slope compared to our results for the surface layer Table 2 . To our knowledge the present study proposes the first analysis of the b bp -to-Chla relationship within the DCM layer. A significant relationship between b bp and Chla is observed and it is associated with the steepest slope the highest RMSE and the lowest coefficient of determination in comparison with the other layers Table 3 . Thus for the DCM layer a given level of b bp is associated with higher values of Chla than predicted by the global relationship of the productive layer. In the next two sections we will investigate the underlying processes leading to the existence or not of a relationship between b bp and Chla and explore the variability of this relationship along the vertical dimension the seasons and the distinct bioregions of the different regimes. For this purpose we will consider the behavior of the b bp :Chla ratio with respect to light conditions and phytoplankton community composition. Influence of the nature of the particulate assemblage on the b bp -to-Chla relationship Although the relationship between POC and b bp is evident in some regions the particulate backscattering coefficient is not a direct proxy of POC. It depends on several parameters such as the concentration of particles in the water column their size distribution shape structure and refractive index Morel and Bricaud 1986 Babin and Morel 2003 Huot et al. 2007b Whitmire et al. 2010 . The b bp coefficient has been shown to be very sensitive to the presence of picophytoplankton as well as of non-algal particles of the submicron size range e.g. detritus bacteria viruses especially in oligotrophic waters Ahn et al. 1992 Stramski et al. 2001 Vaillancourt et al. 2004 but also to particles up to 10 μm Loisel et al. 2007 . In regions with substantial inputs of mineral particles a shift towards enhanced b bp values for a constant Chla level occurs Figs. 4w and x and 5w and x . Substantial concentrations of mineral particles submicrometer particles of Saharan origin for example have been shown to cause significant increases in the particulate backscattering signal Prospero 1996 Claustre et al. 2002 Stramski et al. 2004 Loisel et al. 2011 . The EQNASTZ bioregion exhibits for example particularly high b bp values compared to the low Chla found in the surface layer Figs. 4w and 5w . This is not surprising considering that this region is located in the Equatorial North Atlantic dust belt Kaufman et al. 2005 . The Black Sea is also characterized by a higher b bp signal than predicted from Chla based on our global model Figs. 4x and 5x . This could be explained by the fact that this enclosed sea follows a coastal trophic regime and is strongly influenced by river runoff that may carry small and highly refractive lithogenic particles Ludwig et al. 2009 Tanhua et al. 2013 . Such an increase in backscattering signal may also be related to coccolithophorid blooms Balch et al. 1996a . These small calcifying microalgae highly backscatter light due to their calcium carbonate shell and their presence could explain the episodically higher b bp than predicted by the global regression model particularly in the Black Sea where coccolithophorid blooms are frequently reported Cokacar et al. 2001 Kopelevich et al. 2013 or in the Iceland Basin Holligan et al. 1993 Balch et al. 1996b Fig. 4b or 5b . Recently the b bp :Chla ratio proxy of the POC:Chla ratio Behrenfeld et al. 2015 Álvarez et al. 2016 Westberry et al. 2016 has been used as an optical index of phytoplankton communities with low values associated with a dominance of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage Cetinić et al. 2012 Cetinić et al. 2015 . Indeed in open-ocean waters phytoplankton generally dominate the pool of particles in the water column. A shift towards higher or weaker b bp values at a constant Chla level may be explained by changes in the phytoplankton community composition. However in oligotrophic environments non-algal particles may represent a significant part of the particulate assemblage Yentsch and Phinney 1989 Stramski et al. 2004 Loisel et al. 2007 . Indeed a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or even non-living particles including detritus or inorganic particles could influence the b bp :Chla ratio e.g. Morel and Ahn 1991 Claustre et al. 1999 Stramski et al. 2001 . The lowest b bp :Chla values in our global database occur in summer in the NSPG and SO regimes Figs. 6a-i and are associated with large contributions 40 of microphytoplankton to the total Chla. This actually corroborates the hypothesis of Cetinić et al. 2012 Cetinić et al. 2015 that b bp :Chla can be considered as an optical index of the phytoplankton community composition. High values of the b bp :Chla ratio are associated with large contributions of pico-and nanophytoplankton to algal biomass and low values with diatomdominated communities. The occurrence of microphytoplankton blooms of large-sized phytoplankton community is indeed well-known in the NSPG regime Li 2002 Barton et al. 2015 Cetinić et al. 2015 or in some productive regions of the Southern Ocean Uitz et al. 2009 Georges et al. 2014 Mendes et al. 2015 . Similarly in the NW_MED bioregion low b bp :Chla values are accompanied by large contributions of microphytoplankton during the spring bloom Marty and Chiavérini 2010 Siokou-Frangou et al. 2010 Mayot et al. 2016 . On the opposite high b bp :Chla values in summer are rather associated with dominant contributions of the pico-and nanophytoplankton to the total chlorophyll biomass Fig. 6j and also possibly to higher proportion of non-algal particles consistently with Navarro et al. 2014 or Sammartino et al. 2015 . In the rest of the Mediterranean basin SW_MED TYR_MED and the Eastern Basin Figs. 6k-n as well as in the subtropical regime the phytoplankton biomass is essentially constant throughout the year with high b bp :Chla values in summer lower values in winter and a relatively constant picoplankton-dominated algal community Figs. 6o-w Dandonneau et al. 2004 Uitz et al. 2006 Ras et al. 2008 . In this region the seasonal cycle of the b bp :Chla ratio does not seem to be influenced at a first order by changes in phytoplankton community composition. Influence of photoacclimation on the b bp -to-Chla relationship The Chla is an imperfect proxy of phytoplankton biomass that varies not only with phytoplankton carbon biomass but also with environmental conditions such as light temperature or nutrient availability Cleveland et al. 1989 Babin et al. 1996 Geider et al. 1997 . Phytoplankton cells adjust their intracellular Chla in response to changes in light conditions through the process of photoacclimation Falkowski and Laroche 1991 Lindley et al. 1995 Eisner et al. 2003 Dubinsky and Stambler 2009 . Photoacclimation-induced variations in intracellular Chla may cause large changes in the Chla-to-carbon ratio Geider 1987 Behrenfeld et al. 2005 Sathyendranath et al. 2009 and thus changes in the b bp -to-Chla ratio Behrenfeld and Boss 2003 Siegel et al. 2005 . In the upper oceanic layer of the water column photoacclimation to high light may result in an increase in the b bp -to-Chla ratio whereas a decrease in this ratio occurs in DCM layers or in the upper layer during winter time in subpolar regimes NSPG and SO where photoacclimation to low light occurs. The impact of light conditions on the b bp :Chla ratio in the different regimes is illustrated in Fig. 8 . Significant trends are observed in the different layers of the water column for all regimes except for the Black Sea. In the NSPG and SO regimes the b bp :Chla ratio remains relatively constant with respect to the normalized PAR regardless of the considered layer of the water column Figs. 7a-c . In contrast the Mediterranean Sea and the subtropical gyres show a decoupling between b bp and Chla Fig. 5k-w so the b bp :Chla ratio in the productive mixed or surface layer increases with an increase in the normalized PAR Fig. 7a-c . The seasonal cycle of the b bp :Chla ratio in these regimes results from variations in Chla whereas b bp remains relatively constant over the seasons not shown . Thus our results suggest that the variability in the b bp :Chla ratio in the NSPG and SO regimes is not driven at first order by phytoplankton acclimation to light level even if such a process is known to occur at shorter temporal and spatial scales in those regimes Lutz et al. 2003 Behrenfeld et al. 2015 . On the opposite in both the MED and STG regimes the b bp :Chla ratio variations are essentially driven by phytoplankton photoacclimation. In these oligotrophic regimes Chla within the DCM layer is at least a factor of 2 higher than in the productive layer Fig. 6 . In the lower part of the euphotic zone phytoplankton cells hence adjust their intracellular Chla to low light conditions resulting in a decrease in the b bp :Chla ratio. In addition the b bp :Chla ratio in this layer seems to remain constant within a regime regardless of absolute light conditions Fig. 7d . Actually the absolute values of PAR essentially vary between 10 and 25 μmol quanta m -2 s -1 in all the bioregions along the year with values exceeding 50 μmol quanta m -2 s -1 only in the NW_MED and EQNASTZ bioregions. As reported by Letelier et al. 2004 and Mignot et al. 2014 the DCM may follow a given isolume along the seasonal cycle and is thus essentially light-driven. Finally we suggest that the relative homogeneity of both the environmental PAR conditions and phytoplankton community composition at the DCM level in subtropical regimes may explain the relative stability of the b bp :Chla values in this water column layer. In the Mediterranean Sea in contrast some studies evoke changes in phytoplankton communities in the DCM layer Crombet et al. 2011 suggesting our results might be further explored when relevant data are available. Variability in the b bp -to-Chla relationship is driven by a combination of factors In the previous sections we examined the processes that potentially drive the variability in the b bp -to-Chla relationship in the various oceanic regimes considered here. In the subpolar regimes NSPG and SO changes in the composition of the particle assemblage phytoplankton communities in particular are likely the first-order driver of the seasonal variability in the b bp -to-Chla ratio Fig. 8 . In these regimes the b bp :Chla ratio remains constant regardless of the light intensity in both the productive and surface layers suggesting that phytoplankton photoacclimation is likely not an important driver of the variability in the b bp -to-Chla relationship. We note however that in the SO other factors may come into play such as the light-mixing regime or iron-limitation e.g. Boyd 2002 Blain et al. 2007 Blain et al. 2013 . On the opposite in the subtropical regime Chla and b bp are decoupled in the surface layer as well as in the DCM layer. Thus photoacclimation seems to be the main process driving the vertical and seasonal variability of the b bp -to-Chla relationship although a varying contribution of non-algal particles to the particle pool cannot be excluded. Whereas the subpolar and the subtropical regimes behave as a biomass regime and a photoacclimation regime sensu Siegel et al. 2005 respectively the Mediterranean Sea stands as an intermediate regime between these two end-members. The large number of data available in the Mediterranean allows us to describe this intermediate situation Fig. 8 . The Mediterranean Sea appears as a more complex and variable system than the stable and resilient subtropical gyres. Along with the ongoing development of the global Bio-Argo program and associated float deployments additional data collected in underrepresented regions will become available to make our database more robust and will help to improve our analysis. Indeed in the surface layer of the Mediterranean system a high b bp :Chla ratio in summer has previously been attributed not only to i a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or large contribution of non-living particles including detritus or inorganic particles Claustre et al. 1999 Bricaud et al. 2004 Oubelkheir et al. 2005 or to ii photoacclimation of phytoplankton cells to high light conditions as suggested by Bellacicco et al. 2016 but also to iii a shift towards small phytoplankton dominated communities pico-or nanophytoplankton after the seasonal microphytoplankton bloom. Following the longitudinal trophic gradient of the Mediterranean Sea we observe a variation in the biogeochemical status of the DCM Fig. A1a-d . The DCM may be attributed to low light photoacclimation similarly to the DCM observed in the STG regime. Yet under favorable light and nutrient conditions encountered in the Western Mediterranean basin the DCM could result from a real biomass increase occurring at depth instead of a simple photoacclimation artifact Winn et al. 1995 Beckmann and Hense 2007 Cullen 2014 Mignot et al. 2014 . In such conditions referred to as Deep Biomass Maximum DBM a concurrent increase in Chla and POC associated with large phytoplankton cells leads to constantly low values of the b bp :Chla ratio Fig. 7d . Our results corroborate previous studies Latasa et al. 1992 Crombet et al. 2011 Mignot et al. 2014 about the seasonal occurrence of a DBM in the western basin of Mediterranean sea. This deep feature could actually represent a significant source of phytoplankton carbon biomass that is ignored by satellite ocean color sensors that only probe the surface layer of the water column. CONCLUSIONS The main goal of the present study was to examine the variability of the relationship between the particulate backscattering coefficient and the chlorophyll a concentration over a broad range of oceanic conditions. Using an extensive BGC-Argo profiling float database we investigated the sources of variability in this relationship with respect to the vertical dimension as well as on a seasonal and regional scale. In accordance with previous studies Reynolds et al. 2001 Stramska et al. 2003 Huot et al. 2008 Dall Olmo et al. 2009 Antoine et al. 2011 Xing et al. 2014 and consistently with the so-called bio-optical assumption Smith and Baker 1978b Siegel et al. 2005 a general covariation between b bp and Chla is observed at a global scale Loisel and Morel 1998 in the productive layer of the water column 0-1.5 Z eu . Although this covariation seems to be permanent in subpolar regimes in relation with large-amplitude phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles Henson et al. 2006 Boss and Behrenfeld 2010 Lacour et al. 2015 several nuances have been revealed according to the season considered layer of the water column and bioregion. We suggest that the b bp :Chla ratio proxy of the C:Chla ratio Behrenfeld et al. 2015 Westberry et al. 2016 can be used as an index of the nature composition and size of the particle assemblage in a biomass regime NSPG and SO regimes and Western Mediterranean basin or as a photophysiological index in a photoacclimation regime STG regime and Eastern Mediterranean basin . The present analysis provides insights into the coupling between major proxies of the POC and phytoplankton biomass in key regimes encountered in the world s open oceans. It points to the strong potential of the recently available global BGC-Argo float database to address regional or seasonal nuances in first order relationships that have been established in the past on admittedly restricted datasets. In addition this study stresses out the large variability in the b bp -to-Chla relationship which is critical to the bio-optical modeling of the b bp coefficient in several semi-empirical ocean color models Garver and Siegel 1997 Lee et al. 2002 Maritorena et al. 2002 . Indeed bio-optical and reflectance models require detailed knowledge and parameterization of the average trends in the inherent optical properties especially in open-ocean waters where these trends can be related to Chla. Although the analysis of the impact of such variability on ocean color modeling is out of the scope of the present paper we expect our analysis to be potentially useful in the context of applications to ocean color. Finally as the amount of BGC-float data will continue to increase it will be possible to reassess the variability of bio-optical relationships and to establish new global standards and regional parameterizations.

The vertical profiles of b bp :Chla and PAR were averaged within each of the four considered layers. For each layer both variables the median value was computed monthly and regionally i.e. for each regime . For each layer and each regime we determined the maximum observed PAR that was used to normalize the monthly median PAR values of the corresponding layer and regime PAR norm . Ultimately for each layer and each regime the monthly median PAR norm values were classified into four different intervals 0-0.25 0.25-0.50 0.50-0.75 0.75-1 and the monthly-averaged b bp : Chla values were assigned to one of these four PAR norm intervals.
