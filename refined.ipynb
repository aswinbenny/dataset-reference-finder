These can be effectively tackled via deep learning DL methods. However trustworthy and generalizable DL models commonly require well-curated heterogeneous and large datasets from multiple clinical centers. At the same time owing to legal/ethical issues and privacy concerns forming a large collective centralized dataset poses significant challenges. In this work we aimed to develop a DL-based model in a multicenter setting without direct sharing of data using federated learning FL for AC/SC of PET images. Methods Non-attenuation/scatter corrected and CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected CT-ASC 18F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were enrolled in this study. The dataset consisted of 6 different centers each with 50 patients with scan- ner image acquisition and reconstruction protocols varying across the centers. CT-based ASC PET images served as the standard reference. All images were reviewed to include high-quality and artifact-free PET images. Both corrected and uncorrected PET images were converted to standardized uptake values SUVs . We used a modified nested U-Net utilizing residual U-block in a U-shape architecture. We evaluated two FL models namely sequential FL-SQ and parallel FL-PL and compared their performance with the baseline centralized CZ learning model wherein the data were pooled to one server as well as center-based CB models where for each center the model was built and evaluated separately. Data from each center were divided to contribute to training 30 patients validation 10 patients and test sets 10 patients . Final evaluations and reports were performed on 60 patients 10 patients from each center . Results In terms of percent SUV absolute relative error ARE both FL-SQ CI:12.21-14.81 and FL-PL CI:11.82- 13.84 models demonstrated excellent agreement with the centralized framework CI:10.32-12.00 while FL-based algorithms improved model performance by over 11 compared to CB training strategy CI: 22.34-26.10 . Furthermore the Mann-Whitney test between different strategies revealed no significant differences between CZ and FL-based algorithms p-value 0.05 in center-categorized mode. At the same time a significant difference was observed between the different training approaches on the overall dataset p-value 0.05 . In addition voxel-wise comparison with respect to reference CT-ASC exhibited similar performance for images predicted by CZ R2 0.94 FL-SQ R2 0.93 and FL-PL R2 0.92 while CB model achieved a far lower coefficient of determination R2 0.74 . Despite the strong correlations between CZ and FL-based methods compared to reference CT-ASC a slight underestimation of predicted voxel values was observed. Conclusion Deep learning-based models provide promising results toward quantitative PET image reconstruction. Specifically we developed two FL models and compared their performance with center-based and centralized models. The proposed FL- based models achieved higher performance compared to center-based models comparable with centralized models. Our work provided strong empirical evidence that the FL framework can fully benefit from the generalizability and robustness of DL models used for AC/SC in PET while obviating the need for the direct sharing of datasets between clinical imaging centers. Keywords PET Attenuation correction Deep learning Federated learning Distributed learning This article is part of the Topical Collection on Advanced Image Analyses Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence . Extended author information available on the last page of the article / Published online: 12 December 2022 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 Introduction PET is widely used for in vivo quantification of physiologi- cal processes at the molecular level 1 . The introduction of hybrid imaging in the form of PET/CT has thrived its adop- tion in a clinical setting particularly for oncological applica- tions 1 . Corrections for physical degrading factors mainly linked to the interaction of annihilation photons with matter such as attenuation and Compton scattering are needed to achieve the full potential of quantitative PET imaging 2 . During the image formation process a significant number of annihilation photons undergo photoelectric absorption and multiple Compton interactions with underlying mate- rial along their trajectory patient body scanner hardware etc. before reaching the PET detectors 2 3 . Attenuation and scattering interactions result in undetected annihilation events and the recording of anomalous coincidences respec- tively 4 . This leads to a large tracer uptake quantification bias. It has been reported that a fraction of around 30-35 of all detected events in 3D brain scanning are recorded from scattered photons while this fraction exceeds 50-60 in whole-body scanning 5 . The probability of photon interac- tions increases either with the traveling distance patient s size or the electron density of the medium 4 . Hence for an effective attenuation/scatter correction AC/SC of PET images a prior knowledge of the attenuation map at 511 ke V through the traveling medium is required 4 . The problem of AC/SC to achieve quantitative PET imag- ing has been relatively successfully resolved following the commercial emergence of hybrid PET/CT modality where CT-based correction algorithms are commonly implemented on commercial systems 4 6 . However AC and SC remain challenging on PET/MRI and PET-only scanners 7 8 . Unlike PET/CT direct attenuation correction in PET/MRI is not straightforward owing to the lack of direct correlation between MR signals i.e. proton density and time-relaxa- tion properties of tissues and electron density 8 . Hence various strategies have been devised for MRI-guided AC/ SC including bulk segmentation atlas-based algorithms and emission-based techniques. Although these methods improve the quantification accuracy of PET images they are affected by the misclassification of tissues segmenta- tion-based approach as well as inter/intra-subject variabil- ity of MR images for co-registration to the best-fitted atlas model atlas-based approach 8 . Furthermore in PET-only scanners emission-based algorithms that estimate directly the attenuation map from the emission data time-of-flight TOF information and anatomical prior knowledge have been proposed 9 10 . The past decade has witnessed significant progress in the development and implementation of artificial intelli- gence AI -based methods in different areas of medical image analysis e.g. detection segmentation classifica- tion regression and outcome prediction 11-14 . Several AI-based algorithms in particular deep convolutional neu- ral networks have been developed to address the limita- tions of conventional attenuation correction techniques demonstrating significant benefits in terms of improved image quality and quantitative accuracy of PET imag- ing 15 16 . In this context four main learning-based approaches for AC/SC of PET data including i the gen- eration of synthesized CT from MR images 17 ii gen- erating synthesized CT from non-corrected PET images 18 iii predicting the scattered component from emis- sion information TOF event position in either the image or sinogram domain 10 19 and iv generating directly AC/SC PET images from non-attenuation/scatter corrected images 20 . Although a number of studies reported prom- ising performance of deep learning DL -based algorithms within an acceptable clinical tolerance the size of training and testing datasets is a major limitation of these methods 21 . To build a generalizable and trustworthy DL model a large multicenter dataset is required to tune millions of model parameters 22-24 . However the sensitivity of medical images and the ensuing ethical/legal considera- tions and regulations challenge gathering large datasets to feed such data-hungry algorithms 22-24 . To address this issue federated learning FL initially developed for mobile technologies is being increasingly considered in the healthcare domain 4 . A single hospital often cannot provide a sufficient number of samples as required for successful training of machine learning models with acceptable accuracy generalizability and trustworthiness 22-25 . As such it may not be feasible to train a high-quality model for PET AC/SC images based on a limited sample dataset avail- able from a single hospital. Moreover all hospitals do not have infrastructures and expertise for machine learning model developments. One strategy involves collecting data from different hospitals to train a more accurate model. However this approach is challenged by various privacy regulations and policies on data sharing. FL techniques enable the collaborative training of machine learning mod- els among multiple parties without exchanging the local data to preserve privacy and solve the concerns of data users and data owners 22-24 . A typical FL protocol consists of three main components: i the manager e.g. trusted server ii participating parties as data owners e.g. hospitals and departments and iii computation-communication framework to train the local and global models 26 . Depending on the parties FL pro- tocols can be divided into two settings: i cross-device FL where the parties are edge devices and ii cross-silo FL where the parties are reliable organizations e.g. hospitals . 1035 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 In designing an FL system one needs to consider three prop- erties regarding the participating parties namely a com- putational and storage capacity of the parties b stability and scale of the parties and c data distribution among the parties 27 28 . The manager trusted server or party supervises the training procedure of the global model and manages the communication between the data owners and itself. To produce an accurate model the stability and reli- ability of the server need to be guaranteed 27 28 . In the cross-device setting various solutions have been proposed to increase the reliability of the system 29-32 . Fortunately in the cross-silo setting organizations have powerful com- putational machines better facilitating FL 29-32 . Hence one possible option is to consider one of the organizations as the manager of the FL model 27 28 . Alternatively the organizations can act in a fully decentralized setting. In this setting all the participated parties communicate with each other directly 29-32 . Collaborative models could be trained in a decentralized manner using an FL framework without exchanging data between the different centers/hospitals 27 28 . In recent years FL-based DL models have been applied to multi-insti- tutional data for different medical imaging tasks including image segmentation 33-35 and abnormality detection and classification 36-38 . The main contribution of the pre- sent study is to propose implement and assess a robust FL algorithm for attenuation/scatter correction of PET data to achieve a generalized model using a limited data obtained from each center without direct sharing of data amongst the different centers. The hope is to propose this development for potential applications on standalone CT-less PET scan- ners or enhanced quality assurance in PET/CT scanners. Materials and methods PET/CT datasets Non-attenuation-corrected and CT-based attenuation-cor- rected 18F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were included in this study. The dataset were acquired at 6 different centers each providing 50 patients acquired on various PET scan- ners using different image acquisition and reconstruction protocols across the different centers more information of dataset is provided in Table 1 20 39-47 . All images were reviewed to include only high-quality and artifact-free PET images. PET images were converted to standardized uptake values SUVs for both corrected and non-corrected images. Image preprocessing We converted all PET images to SUV values and resa- mpled both NAC and CT-ASC PET images to the same voxel spacing 3 3 4 mm3 and finally normalized by empirical values of 3 and 9 for NAC and CT-ASC respectively. To harmonize the intensity range of PET images across the different centers the voxel values of both non-AC and CT-AC PET images were converted to SUV. Subsequently non-ASC and CT-ASC PET images were normalized by SUV factors of 3 and 9 respectively.

Global FL training In typical machine learning problems the goal is to mini- mize an appropriate loss function F θ where θ Rd denotes the parameters of the model. The loss function F θ represents the average of empirical loss functions over the available data samples with respect to model parameter θ . A common approach to minimize the loss function F θ is to use the iterative Stochastic Gradient Descent SGD algorithm. The idea of federated DL originates from the fact that SGD allows parallelization 26 48-53 . Hence one can optimize a machine learning model using distrib- uted SGD. The framework is as follows. Consider the FL system with K parties where the k-th party has a local training dataset Dk Xi Yi Nk i 1 where Xi and Yi are the feature vector and the ground-truth label vector respectively and Nk is the sample size available at partyk 1 2 . K . Let all parties have N K k 1 Nk samples and let Fk θ denotes the local objective function of the k-th client i.e. we have: where θ Rd denotes the model parameters to be opti- mized and L . . is the specific loss function. As an exam- ple one can consider the mean square error loss func- tion LΘ Xi Yi 1 2 yi - yi 2 2 where yi is the corresponding predicted label and . is the l2-norm. In this case we consider the global optimization problem of our FL system as follows: In this framework the local objective function for each center is weighted by the fraction of data emerging from that center. In order to solve the above optimization problem the SGD algorithm can be utilized. Therefore at the t th iteration each party computes local gradients using the SGD method and sends them back to the manager server for aggregation and updating. Let Fk 휃t denote the local gradient on the local data of the k th party at the t th iteration. Let 휂 represent the learning rate and let 휃t denote the model at tth iteration. The server aggregates and updates the model parameters as follows: 1 Fk θ 1 Nk Nk i 1 L 휃 Xi Yi 2 min θ F 휃 K k 1 Nk N Fk 휃 3 휃t 1 휃t -휂 K k 1 Nk N Fk 휃t Note that in the case of massive datasets the SGD becomes prohibitively demanding. Hence the parameter vector is updated with the stochastic gradient: where 피 G 휃t F 휃t . We evaluate two different training strategies for our feder- ated pipeline. In the first training approach a server aggre- gates the FL workflow as summarized in Fig. 1. We refer to this first strategy as parallel federated learning FL-PL : first step A the central global model is distributed through dif- ferent departments and then step B the models are trained in each center separately and finally step C the locally trained models return to the central server and aggregate the results to the central global model. Steps A-C are repeated until the model is fully trained and converges. In the second approach referred to as sequential federated learning FL- SQ the model meets the data serially center-after-center. First step A in Fig. 1 model training begins in one center for a predefined number of epochs and then step B the model passes sequentially through all centers. Finally step C this process will be repeated for a predefined number of rounds to generate the ultimate model. FL-SQ requires longer training time since the learning procedure is sequen- tial. As for the implementation of our experiments all FL algorithms and DL models were implemented in Tensor Flow 2.6 details on DL models are provided below . The FL pro- cess in this work was performed on a server with multiple local GPUs similar to previous studies 36 54-59 where each local GPU was considered as our node and center. Deep neural network In this study we used the modified U2-Net 60 which utilizes residual U-blocks in a U-shaped architecture. It employs a deep network supervision strategy where the training loss includes information in all scales. Deep super- vision allows to extract both local and global contextual information 60 . The advantage is that unlike the preva- lently utilized U-Net based on successive down-sampling of the image and hence gradually losing high-resolution information 60 the U2-Net does not sacrifice the high- resolution content of the images 60 which is crucial for many image-to-image conversion tasks such as attenuation scatter correction. This is performed using a nested two-level U-structure inspired from the classical U-Net. The idea is to keep the general U-structure of the U-Net 61 but inside each convolutional block it uses another structure which again 4 휃t 1 휃t -휂t G 휃t 1037 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 Fig. 1 Schematic of two FL algorithms and network architectures as implemented in this study. In parallel federated learning FL-PL in the first step A the central global model is distributed through different centers and then B the models are trained in each center separately and finally C local-trained models return to the central server and aggregate the results to the central global model. Steps A-C are repeated until the model is fully trained and converged. In sequential federated learning FL-SQ the model meets the data seri- ally center-after-center. First step A in Fig. 1 model training begins in one center for a predefined number of epochs and then step B the model passes sequentially through all centers. Finally step C this process will be repeated for a predefined number of rounds to gener- ate the ultimate model. The bottom image depicts our U2Net archi- tecture each blue block in the main body left consists of a residual U-Net right 1038 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 has a U-shaped form with its symmetric encoder-decoder architecture 60 . This block is known as Re Sidual U-block RSU which enables intra-stage multi-scale features to be extracted. The RSU is motivated by the classic U-Net 61 with a symmetric encoder-decoder structure. It provides a mixture of receptive fields with different sizes which is highly desirable for fine-grained image-to-image tasks 60 . This is equivalent to drastically increasing network layers but with the important advantage of keeping the compu- tational and memory footprint low and hence the training procedure simple 60 . Note that the idea of having nested U-Net is different from the more common strategy of cas- cading multiple U-Nets together which increases the com- putational burden proportional to the number of networks used 60 . The nested structure enables the U2-Net to extract intra-stage multi-scale as well as aggregated inter-stage multi-level features 60 . As for the training strategy the network further uses deep supervision where the training loss includes information in all scales 60 . Deep supervision allows to further extract both local and global contextual information 60 . It can evoke intra-stage features in different scales depending on the depth and kernel size 60 . One can select an optional depth to achieve various single-level or multi- level nested U-shape structures 60 . Although too deep models might get too complex with respect to implementa- tion and employment in training procedures and real-world applications. In this work non-attenuation/scatter-corrected images were used as input to the modified U2-Net to generate attenuation/scatter-corrected PET images directly. The net- work was trained in a 2D manner with an Adam optimizer a learning rate of 0.001 an L2-norm loss as well as a weight decay of 0.0001. The schema of the network is depicted in Fig. 1. Evaluation strategy In this study we evaluated two federated models referred to as FL-SQ and FL-PL and compared their performance with the centralized CZ approach wherein the data are pooled to one server. Moreover center-based CB models were built and evaluated separately using only the training/ test datasets from the same center. Each center s data were divided into training 30 patients validation 10 patients and test sets 10 patients . A standard train/validation/test data splitting was followed for the training of all models and the results were reported on untouched test sets to avoid the risk of overfitting. There was no overlap between training validation and testing sets. The same patients were used for evaluation of the different non-CB models to facilitate comparison of the various models. In the three non-CB strat- egies including FL-SQ FL-PL and CS the models were built using a 180/60 train/validation set and the results were reported using 60 test sets the 10 test datasets from each of the six centers . In CB models six different models were developed using 30/10 train/validation and only 10 test sets from the same center were employed for model evaluation. For model performance evaluation voxel-wise mean error ME mean absolute error MAE relative error RE absolute relative error ARE and peak signal-to- noise ratio PSNR were computed between ground truth CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected and the predicted corrected PET images as follows: where PETpredicted denotes DL-based corrected PET image while PETCT-ASC stands for the reference PET-CT- ASC image and vxl and v denote the total number of voxels and voxel index respectively. Moreover the structural simi- larity index SSIM was calculated based on 62 . The different plots box bar and scatter plots were pro- vided to enable different comparisons. Two-sample Wil- coxon test Wilcoxon rank sum test or Mann-Whitney test was used for the statistical comparison of image-derived metrics between the different training models. We corrected p-values using Benjamin Homberg to provide an adjusted p-value q-value . A threshold of 0.05 was considered as the significance level of q-values. In addition we used joint histogram analysis to depict the distribution of voxel-wise PET SUV correlations between the reference CT-based ASC images and different DL approaches. Results Figure 2 represents an example of non-ASC CT-ASC CB model CZ model FL-SQ model FL-PL model and the cor- responding bias maps generated for DL models with respect to CT-based ASC CT-ASC images. As can be seen the CZ-based model FL-SQ model and FL-PL model generated 5 ME 1 vxl vxl v 1 PETPredicted v -PETCT-ASC v 6 MAE 1 vxl vxl v 1 PETpredicted v -PETCT-ASC v 7 RE 1 vxl vxl v 1 PETpredicted v - PETCT-ASC v PETCT-ASC v 100 8 ARE 1 vxl vxl v 1 PETpredicted v - PETCT-ASC v PETCT-ASC v 100 9 PSNR d B 10log10 Peak2 MSE 1039 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 high-quality images.

The performance of the FL-based algorithms is com- parable with the centralized training strategy while the CZ method shows a lower deviation and smaller vari- ance compared to FL-SQ and FL-PL in terms of MAE 0.10 0.03 versus 0.14 0.07 and 0.14 0.06 respec- tively . Table 2 summarizes the statistical comparisons of quantitative metrics between these four training strate- gies. In terms of overall structural similarity the different approaches demonstrated comparable performance against ground truth CZ 0.93 0.01 FL-SQ 0.93 0.01 and FL-PL 0.92 0.03 except for the CB achieving an SSIM of 0.70 0.04. Table 3 summarizes the statistical comparison of quantitative metrics calculated between these four training strategies separately for each center. The same pattern of quantitative metrics in Table 2 is repeated for each center and all metrics across the differ- ent frameworks. The quantitative performance of the different training strategies categorized by the clinical center is reported in Fig. 4 Supplemental Fig. 2 depicts similar information for each patient . The center-wise relative error for the CZ approach ARE 11.16 3.24 demonstrates slightly bet- ter performance compared to FL-SQ ARE 13.51 5.04 and FL-PL ARE 12.83 3.91 approaches. Conversely ARE metric for the CB approach was larger 24.22 7.28 .

In terms of SUV quantifica- tion bias the ARE metric demonstrated excellent agree- ment between FL-SQ CI:12.21-14.81 and FL-PL CI:11.82-13.84 models and conventional centralized training approach CI:10.32-12.00 while FL-based algorithms improved model performance in terms of ARE by more than 11 compared to CB training strategy CI: 22.34-26.10 . The center-based voxel-wise quantitative analysis and structural indices Figs. 3 and 4 illustrated the superior performance of FL-based algorithms compared to the CB approach.

Even though slightly inferior results were observed in some CB models which could be attrib- uted to the different number of slices used in the training of the models as reflected in Table 1 . Overall all CB models exhibited very similar values of quantitative errors. In a previous study in the context of conventional cen- tralized learning 20 direct AC/SC of PET images using a modified Res Net algorithm achieved good performance MAE 0.22 0.09 and ARE 11.61 4.25 using a large dataset 1150 patient images as gathered from one center and single PET scanner 20 . We then further improved the performance of our algorithm by developing a modi- fied bilevel nested U-NET architecture inspired by U2-Net applied for object detection from natural images central- ized mode: MAE 0.10 0.03 and ARE 11.16 3.24 . In our previous study 20 DL-based attenuation and scat- ter correction in the image domain were extensively evalu- ated on 150 clinical cases including quantitative analysis of radiotracer uptake in 170 lesions/abnormal high-uptake regions colorectal head and neck lung lymphoma . . A mean relative SUV error of less than 5 was observed for SUVmax and SUVmean across all lesions/regions. Although the quantitative analysis was not performed on malignant lesions in the current study the voxel-wise SUV error for CZ and FL algorithms was within the same range as our previous study 20 . In comparison to previous works Yang et al. 63 reported an average ARE of 16.55 4.43 for AC/SC of whole-body PET images using 3D generative adversarial networks. Dong et al. 64 tested different network architec- tures U-Net GAN and cycle-GAN achieving good per- formance in terms of ME 0.62 1.26 and normalized mean square error 0.72 0.34 respectively. Van Hem- men et al. 65 developed a modified U-Net architecture for AC/SC of whole body PET images only images resulting in an average ARE of 28.2 on a small-scale dataset. Hwang et al. 66 compared different PET attenuation correction approaches using emission data including DL-based μ-map generation from non-attenuation-corrected NAC images improved estimation of μ-maps using maximum likeli- hood estimation of activity and attenuation MLAA and a combination of these two methods. They reported that the combination of the MLAA algorithm and DL approach outperformed μ-maps estimated from NAC PET images whereas no improvement was observed when combin- ing these two approaches. Apart from direct AC/SC on PET images a number of studies reported on MRI-guided AC/SC by generating pseudo-CT images from PET/MR images and attenuation maps based on tissue classification from PET-only images 67-69 . Although the synthesized attenuation map-based approaches demonstrate promising results they suffer from numerous challenges including a mismatch between anatomical MRI and PET images and organ motion 67-69 . However the direct AC/SC approach is less sensitive to noise metal artifacts truncation and local mismatch between anatomical and functional images 70 71 . Furthermore this approach is potentially capable of correcting for organ motion and hollow artifacts provided that the model is trained on a clean and accurately corrected PET images 20 70 . Although direct attenuation/scatter correction in the image domain has a number of advantages the generation of pseudo μ-maps synthetic CT from non-attenuation cor- rected images or MR images would provide an explainable AC map to verify/detect errors/drawbacks within PET atten- uation and scatter correction procedures 20 66 72 73 . The suboptimal performance of direct AC approaches cannot be easily depicted from the resulting PET-AC images local under/over estimation of radiotracer uptake . However the suboptimal performance of DL-based synthetic CT genera- tion approaches could be visually detected from the result- ing synthetic μ-maps. The resulting synthetic CT images could be visually checked to detect any possible anatomical defects and/or artifacts prior to PET attenuation correction. The other drawback of direct AC in the image domain is the sensitivity of the models to the quality of the query data wherein increased levels of noise abnormalities and minor image artifacts may result in erroneous signals in the result- ing images. Moreover the occurrence of outliers cases with gross errors in the outcome of these models should be care- fully monitored owing to black-box nature of DL models . Different studies have been recently performed to assess the performance of FL approaches in medical image analy- sis 74 . In a study by Feki et al. 36 COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images using VGG16 and Res Net50 tested federated and centralized frameworks reporting similar per- formance for both models. In a more recent study 37 an FL-based model referred to as EXAM was developed based on vital signs laboratory exams and chest X-rays for future oxygen requirements of COVID-19 patients across twenty centers. They compared the FL-based model with the center- based model where each center developed and evaluated the model separately achieving 16 and 38 improvement in average AUC and generalizability respectively. Gawali et al. 75 compared different privacy-preserving DL methods for chest X-ray classification tasks. They reported an AUROC of 0.95/0.72 and an F1 score of 0.93/0.62 for a Dense Net model trained in a centralized way and their best-performing FL approach respectively. In our study we evaluated two FL-based models and achieved better and comparable results for CB and CZ models respectively. Building a generaliz- able and robust model requires a large dataset while privacy 1045 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 concerns could be addressed by FL approaches without sacrificing models performance. In a more recent study Shiri et al. 76 proposed a FL based multi-institutional PET image segmentation framework on head and neck studies. They enrolled 404 patients from eight different centers and reported that FL-based algorithms outperformed CB and achieved similar performance as the CZ approach. The FL paradigm enables the training of machine/DL models on multiple decentralized datasets without the need for exchanging data. This preserves data privacy data secu- rity and data access rights while allowing access to the large-scale heterogeneous database for model training 77 . In the FL framework the local data are not made available to other participants or on the server. However a curious server may infer sensitive data from the exchanged model parameters. In the literature various attacks have been investigated against machine learning models 78 79 . For instance Shokri et al. 80 studied membership inference attacks whereas Fredrikson et al. 81 addressed model inversion attacks. Possible threats can be classified into three categories depending on the stage of the process of an FL system. Malicious parties can perform data poisoning attacks at the input of the learning model 82 83 . For instance they may modify the label of the data samples. Alternatively they can perform model poisoning attacks during the learning process 84 85 . For example they may upload random updates to the global model. Finally a mali- cious party can perform inference attacks on the released learnt model 77 80 81 . For instance a curious server may infer sensitive information about the training data from the communicated model parameters. CB framework faces generalizability challenges even with large datasets owing to the large variability across different centers in terms of scanner brands data acqui- sition and reconstruction protocols and post-processing schemes. Moreover due to the absence of infrastructures and expertise it may not possible to build ML models at each center. The CZ training framework is the ideal option for ML model development. Yet it suffers from limitations imposed by ethical and legal constraints. FL algorithms provide the opportunity to train a model using multicentric datasets without sharing data and models trained with the FL framework can converge to the CZ performance in the ideal situation. Overall the CZ model training would lead to the highest accuracy and general- izability. However in cases where ethical and legal con- straints do not allow data sharing or when a center does not have enough training samples FL approaches would be an attractive solution. Models trained with FL in the best-case scenario might approach the performance of the CZ models. On the other hand CB models are observed to suffer from very poor generalizability. Data heterogeneity arising from the use of different scan- ners image acquisition and reconstruction protocols is the main source of error impairing building a generalizable model 17 . The heterogeneity of data across the different centers prevents CB models from working properly on an unseen dataset from the other centers. To build a generaliz- able model data from different centers should be included in the training dataset which is possible in CZ and FL pipe- lines. In FL a global model is built based on a portion of the data from the different centers in a federated approach and then for each center the global model will be specialized for each center by applying a transfer learning technique using a transfer-FL framework 27 28 . This approach could be employed to comply with the heterogeneous data col- lected from the different centers with various acquisition parameters. This study inherently bears a number of limitations. The implementation of all models was performed on a server using different GPUs where the different nodes were considered as centers similar to previous FL studies 35 36 54-59 74 76 . The challenges of FL such as local computer capacity and communication bottleneck between centers and local server should be considered in the real clinical scenario. Further studies should be performed in real clinical situations using a larger size of the training dataset. In the current version a proof-of-concept has been demonstrated and further inves- tigation with larger cohorts is warranted. One limitation of FL is data preparation and preprocessing due to the nature of the decentralized process. However for image preprocessing including normalization we used an easy method to ensure reproducibility. Conclusion AC/SC are key corrections required to enable quantitative PET imaging which remains challenging on CT-less PET scanners PET/MRI and standalone PET-only scanners . DL-based models provide very promising results and might outperform conventional algorithms in terms of attenua- tion and scatter corrections. At the same time robust and generalizable DL models require heterogeneous large and reliable datasets from multiple centers. Yet legal/ethical/ privacy considerations prevent the collection of very large datasets. In this work we developed an FL-based framework for anatomical knowledge free or CT-less AC/SC of PET images which proved to outperform center-based models demonstrating comparable performance with respect to centralized DL. FL-based DL provided promising results through improving model generalizability and robustness for AC/SC of PET images without direct sharing of datasets amongst centers. 1046 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2023 50:1034-1050 1 3 Supplementary Information The online version contains supplemen- tary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00259- 022- 06053-8.

Email: rubikraf gmail.com Funding information Nitobe School Project Abstract Field observations on small rivers of the Amazon basin are less common due to their remote location and difficult accessibility. Here we show through remote sensing analysis and field works the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin the Ichilo River. By tracking plan- form changes over 30 years we identified the factors that control meander migration rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs climate and human interventions. The data suggest that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River with an annual density of 0.022 cutoffs/km. In addition climate controls have been identified in the form of high-precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs an increase in meander migration rate and channel widening. The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions. The spatio- temporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in two locations where neck cutoffs are expected. Analysing the distance across the neck in these two points we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff. The combined methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution where two scour holes were identified. Finally we discuss the impact of planform changes of the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks.

There we can find many of the fastest meandering rivers in the world where cutoffs oxbow lakes and meandering scars are evidence of the evolution that these rivers have experienced over time. Numerous riverine communities have been established along meandering rivers of the Amazon basin. These communities depend on the abundant natural resources available where their main eco- nomic activities include fishery agriculture and navigation. Although riverine communities show a strong dependency on river activity Lombardo 2016 the morphodynamics of meandering rivers are also affected by human activity even changing their planform shape and bend meander migration rates Schwenk Foufoula-Georgiou 2016 . However it is not only human-induced activities that affect the plan- form configuration of this meandering system but also natural pertur- bations. A meander neck cutoff is a natural perturbation that occurs when the river intersects itself Schwenk Foufoula-Georgiou 2016 Schwenk et al. 2015 modifying its current planform configuration. Bend development and sinuosity growth are limited by the occurrence of cutoffs Van Dijk 2013 . Previous studies have demonstrated that neck cutoffs heavily influence the development of meandering rivers in terms of planform shape hydraulics and sedimentology both in the short and long term Camporeale et al. 2008 Li et al. 2020 Schwenk Foufoula-Georgiou 2016 .

Researchers have exploited the potential of remote sensing Gomes et al. 2018 Lombardo 2016 Schwenk Foufoula-Georgiou 2016 Schwenk et al. 2017 field works and numerical models to study the planform morphodynamics of these rivers. Each methodology with its advan- tages and limitations highlights the importance of integrating differ- ent approaches in a complementary way to investigate meandering rivers whenever possible Van Dijk 2013 . Most of the research carried out in the Amazon basin is concen- trated on the main tributaries of the Amazon River Lombardo 2016 while the number of studies in small rivers is limited especially in the upper foreland Amazon basin due to their remote location and diffi- cult accessibility. However a large part of the Amazon network is composed of small rivers Strahler stream order less than 7 Lombardo 2016 . Meandering rivers in the upper Amazon basin that are located close to the Andes range have interesting characteristics such as hydrological cycles with numerous peaks around the year even in the low season short inundation periods and high sediment transport regardless of their low discharge when compared to rivers of the central and low Amazon basin Lombardo 2016 Rejas 2018 . There is a need to understand the morphodynamics of rivers in the upper foreland Amazon basin. This paper explores the planform morphodynamics and bed topography of the Ichilo River a small meandering river in the upper part of the Bolivian Amazon basin in order to identify controls on meander migration and planform evolution such as neck cutoffs climate and anthropogenic interventions. We discuss bank erosion and bank accretion processes the spatial variation of the meander migration rates and future planform evolution of the Ichilo River. Also we discuss how changes in the river have and will impact the riverine communities established on the Ichilo River. Our study is divided into two parts. In the first part the temporal and spatial evolution of the Ichilo River is studied using remote sens- ing analysis for a period of 30 years in order to understand the plan- form morphodynamics of the river. In the second part we present the results of two field campaigns that were performed in order to collect bathymetric data using a mul- tibeam echosounder MBES and investigate bank and bed erosion processes using structure from motion Sf M photogrammetry. Finally the results are analysed together and we discuss the planform changes during the last 30 years and the future planform develop- ment of the Ichilo River with emphasis on the impact it may cause on the inhabitants of its riverbanks. 2 AREA OF STUDY The Ichilo River belongs to the upper part of the Amazon basin in Bolivia. It serves as a natural border between the departments of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba Figure 1 . The Ichilo River meanders from south to north from the Andes range to the Bolivian savannah forest. The river reach of the Ichilo presents a single-thread meandering configuration that starts almost immediately after F I G U R E 1 Location of the Ichilo River and its tributary in Bolivia.

The Ichilo River has many tributaries such as the Vibora Izozog Isarzama and Sajta rivers among others. The Sajta is an important tributary because it connects with the Ichilo near the city of Puerto Villarroel. The Ichilo River and its tributaries end up in the Mamorecillo River and continue flowing until they become the Mamoré River. The Ichilo River is the Andean tributary of the Mamore River which later joins the Madeira River and then reaches the Amazon. The Ichilo River is characterized as being an active migrating river with high sinuosity. Cutoffs oxbow lakes paleochannels and meandering scars from old paths of the Ichilo River remain as testi- mony of this behaviour. Recently the study of Lombardo 2016 has reported annual aver- age migration rates of 0.034 channel widths/year and an average annual width of 134.2 19.35 m for the Ichilo River. The water levels in the Ichilo River show high variability where peaks are observed even during the dry season June to October when water levels are the lowest Figures 2a-c . Water level data were analysed and the statistics of the annual water levels are presented in Figure 2b. The dataset consists of 31 years of daily water levels ranging from 1988 to 2019. Figure 2b presents three sets of data: 1 the annual maximum water level blue asterisks 2 the annual minimum water level red dots and 3 the mean annual water level yellow squares . The data show that water levels each year decreased below the 2 m level and reached values higher than 6 m. The maximum water levels exceeded the flooding level 7.83 m affecting the city of Puerto Villarroel with inundations in the years 2019-2016 2014 2013 2010-2007 2003 1995 and 1992 Figure 3 .

See the Terms and Conditions https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions on Wiley Online Library for rules of use OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License From 1988 to 2018 a total of 10 cutoffs were observed in a length of around 150 km of the Ichilo River which indicates a density of 0.022 cuttoffs/km per year. One of these cutoffs corresponds to a human-induced cutoff designed by Peters 1998 in order to avoid a natural cutoff Figure 4a expected to occur during the year 1996-1997. The objective of this human-induced cutoff was to pro- tect a port Puerto Villarroel that had been constructed in the banks of the Ichilo River and remains there today Figure 4b . In terms of area this cutoff is the largest observed during the studied period. 3 METHODOLOGY Here a combination of remote sensing analysis and field measure- ments was used to study the active meandering behaviour of the Ichilo River. The remote sensing analysis corresponded to a spatial and temporal analysis for a period of 30 years 1988-2018 . Field data were acquired during two field campaigns performed at the Ichilo River during the rainy season in February and May 2019 respectively. During the first campaign orthophotos were collected using unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs and a pocket erodometer test PET was performed on the banks of the Ichilo River to check the erodibil- ity of the bank material. The second campaign May had the objective of performing a bathymetric survey using a MBES complemented with Sf M. 3.1 History of Ichilo River from satellite imagery Satellite imagery of the area of study of the Ichilo River was down- loaded from Landsat 5 L5 and Landsat 8 L8 using the Google Earth Engine GEE Gorelick et al. 2017 . The analysis started upstream in the confluence of the Ichilo River with the Izozog River and continued 150 km along the Ichilo River until the confluence with the Chapare River Figure 1 . The analysis period was from 1988 to 2018 a period of 30 years and we tried to obtain imagery at an annual time scale. However in all years most of the imagery was partially or totally covered by cloud especially during the rainy season November to May . The classifica- tion and the creation of channel masks was performed similarly to in Schwenk et al. 2017 . 3.1.1 Classification of satellite imagery Each year the satellite imagery was analysed searching for cloud-free images for the area of study for the period of low flow from June to October except in 2008 when we used an image from the month of November. Only cloud-free images were considered in the analysis and the dataset used for the analysis is shown in Table 1. The main objective of the imagery analysis was to obtain a well-defined full channel mask of the river for each year. Each image was classified using a support vector machine SVM classifi- cation model using the GGE. The classification of the imagery followed three steps: training data classifying and assessment. The first step consisted of collecting training data of the known pixel F I G U R E 4 Comparison of the evolution of Ichilo River before and after human-induced cutoff. a Picture taken before the occurrence of the human-induced cutoff red circle indicates the location where the natural cutoff was expected.

Then the classification was performed using a SVM classification model. After the classification a cleaning process was performed manually fol- lowing the methodology of Schwenk et al. 2017 . As a result of the classification we obtained binary images with a defined chan- nel and the information was used as input for the analysis of the planform metrics. 3.1.2 Planform analysis The analysis of the planforms was performed using the Riv MAP River Morphodynamics from Analysis of Planforms toolbox Schwenk et al. 2017 . Riv MAP consists of a combination of MATLAB codes based on the image-processing morphological operations offered by MATLAB Schwenk et al. 2017 . This toolbox was developed to calcu- late the metrics of meandering rivers from channel masks as input. The following information was quantified with the toolbox: centrelines banklines river widths migrated areas cutoffs erosion and accretion rates see Schwenk et al. 2017 for more information on the Riv MAP toolbox . In addition the extracted river widths along the Ichilo River were analysed in order to assess their spatiotemporal distribution. In gen- eral a general extreme value GEV distribution provides the best data fit for width sequences in meandering rivers Lopez Dubon Lanzoni 2019 . For each year different probability distribution func- tions PDFs were tested to fit the annual histograms of the dimen- sionless widths and the most appropriate function was selected using a Bayesian information criterion BIC as suggested by Lopez Dubon and Lanzoni 2019 . 3.2 Field measurements As mentioned before two field surveys were performed during February and May 2019 to acquire data. During the first field cam- paign February 2019 we used a UAV to capture orthophotos along one bend of the Ichilo River where a cutoff is expected F1 . The objective of this campaign was to identify areas of bank erosion by taking orthophotos with the UAV and assess the location in order to perform a second more complete field campaign. Also field measure- ments of the erodibility of the bank in the Ichilo River were made using a PET Briaud et al. 2012 . This method provides an idea of the soil erodibility using small inexpensive apparatus that was easy to carry to the location. The methodology consisted of shooting a horizontal jet of water into the vertical face of the bank using a mini jet pulse device a water gun pistol Figure 5a . Pulses of water were squeezed at an interval of 1 s with a repeti- tion of 20 times. The depth of the hole was measured using a digital calliper Figure 5b . The procedure was repeated four times along the bank and then the measured depth was introduced in the PET table from Briaud et al. 2012 to determine the erodibility category of the soil among five categories: very high erodibility I high erodibility II medium erodibility III low erodibility IV and very low erodibility V . The results of the test in the Ichilo River are shown in Table 2. The PET erosion category was II showing a soil of high erodibility 15-75 mm . The detailed methodology of the PET is described in Briaud et al. 2012 . During the second field campaign topographic data from the banks were obtained by applying Sf M photogrammetry. We surveyed the banks using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Mavic Pro was used for taking pictures. Details of the equipment survey design and exe- cution and other details are shown below as suggested in James et al. 2019 . The Phantom 4 Pro is equipped with a FC6310S camera that uses a 1-inch CMOS sensor at 20 megapixels with an aperture range from F2.8 to F11 and a 24 mm equivalent focal length. The image size was 5472 3648. The nominal flight height was around 181.4 m and the ground sample distance was 5 cm with a front and side overlap ratio of 80 and 75 respectively. Before taking the imag- ery we marked ground control points GCPs along the banks wher- ever access to the area was possible in order to georeference the digital elevation model DEM . The GCPs were white crosses around 1 m size marked using latex painting and easily visible in the aerial imagery. A total of 44 GCPs were marked along the riverbanks and their coordinates measured using a real-time kinematic RTK GPS unit. After the GCPs were marked the UAVs were launched and pic- tures taken including the GCPs a total of 1358 pictures were taken during the surveys. The imagery was analysed and processed using Agisoft Photo Scan software which compares the imagery and finds homologous points in each picture. The GCPs were split into two groups: the first group with 30 GCPs was used to correct the imagery F I G U R E 5 Pocket erodometer test in Ichilo River: a mini jet pulse device used in the experiment b measurement of the depth using a digital caliper Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com T A B L E 2 Measured depths with the PET and erosion category of the soil in the riverbank of the Ichilo River A B C D Averaged PET erosion depth mm 26 25 5.5 18.4 18.7 Erosion category II II III II II ARNEZ FERREL ET AL. 719 10969837 2021 4 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.5058 Wiley Online Library on 31/03/2025 .

The processed imagery taken in May resulted in orthophotos and a DEM covering around 350 hectares of terrain. The mean posi- tional errors of the 14 reserved GCPs were 0.003 0.004 and 0.06 m in the x y and z directions respectively. Underwater features of the Ichilo River were measured through bathymetric surveys. An interferometric MBES and an inertial navi- gation system INS was attached to a boat and surveyed along 14 km of the Ichilo River and 2 km of its tributary the Sajta River. The data can be accessed through the U.S. Geological Survey USGS data release website Kinzel et al. 2019 which includes survey point data in metres in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 20 South. The DEM was created at 1 m resolution and was com- bined with the DEM obtained from the UAV surveys to obtain cross-sections of the river. Additionally soil samples were taken at two point bars in the river and values for the mean grain size were obtained. 4 RESULTS 4.1 Mechanisms of meander migration Figure 6 serves as evidence of the changing nature of the Ichilo River showing the paths where the river used to flow through the last 30 years. Moreover it helps us to identify the location of the migrated areas and the occurrence of cutoffs. As expected in a meandering river the planform shape indicates that the erosion area was larger in the concave parts of the bends while the deposition area was observed in their inner part. Furthermore cutoffs were identified and shown in a detailed zoom Figure 6 . Although we observed both chute cutoffs and neck cutoffs the dominant type of cutoff in the Ichilo River was the neck cutoff Figures 6 and 7 with a total of 10 neck cutoffs in our stud- ied area. The largest cutoff in terms of area observed in the Ichilo River corresponds to a human-induced cutoff cutoff 9 Figures 6 and 7 located near the confluence with the Sajta River. The annual reach-averaged migration rates of the Ichilo River for the analysed period are presented in Figure 8. The reach considered in the calculations corresponds to the river length shown in Figure 6. An increase in migration rates is observed from 2005 with a peak occurring in 2008. The spike in migration rates measured after 2005 seems to correlate with the occurrence of many cutoffs. Four cutoffs were observed between 2007 and 2010 together with an increase in the annual averaged river width as observed in Figure 8b. Again after 2014-2015 two cutoffs were observed and also correlate with increases in the annual averaged river width. From November 2007 to April 2008 Bolivia suffered a severe sea- son of flooding where the city of Puerto Villarroel was affected by La Niña events. The data indicate that the Ichilo River remained flooded for 5 days in January 2008 with water levels over bank level 7.8 m . Another event of high precipitation was registered in 2014 when water levels remained over bank level for almost 23 days being the largest event registered in the 30-year period. It is possible that the high mean- der migration rates in 2008 were related to the high-precipitation event occurring in that year and this could have triggered the development of the cutoffs that were observed in the following years. Similar to the event of 2008 the high precipitation observed in 2014 seemed to have promoted the occurrence of cutoffs and increased the river width but no change in meander migration rates was observed. Furthermore the maximum annual stage Smax was plotted against the annual averaged migration rate Mrcl Figure 9a and the results show a small to moderate correlation R2 0.16 . Two points in the Ichilo River cutoff F1 and cutoff F2 see location in Figure 7 were identified to be susceptible to the occur- rence of a cutoff. We compared the evolution of the distance before cutoff occurrence in both sections using satellite imagery and orthophotos Figure 9b . The graph indicates that the distance across the neck of F1 decreased at a faster rate than in F2. The distance across the neck in F1 decreased by 87.4 of the initial distance 761.7 m in 1988 while the neck distance in F2 decreased 47.8 F I G U R E 6 Meander migration areas for 30-year period.

Our last field measurement from the orthophotos obtained in May 2019 showed that the distance left to the intersection and for- mation of cutoff in F1 neck was 96.1 m. Figure 10 compares the orthophotos in the location of cutoff F1 for the months of a February and b May 2019. 4.1.1 Spatiotemporal distribution of channel widths Lopez Dubon and Lanzoni 2019 discussed how width fluctuations can be described by a GEV probability distribution. In the case of the Ichilo River we applied many PDFs and found that a GEV distribution is the best fit for the period 1988-2013 while from years 2014 to 2018 an inverse Gaussian distribution represents the variation of the data better. An example of the analysis of the histograms and the fitted PDFs for years 1988 and 2018 is shown in Figure 11. The annual PDFs of the Ichilo River in the studied period are pres- ented in Figure 12a. In the period of Figure 12b three cutoffs were observed in years 2008 2009 and 2010 and in Figure 12c cutoffs occurred in years 2014 and 2015. The main changes in the PDFs occurred in years with cutoffs while in years without cutoffs 2016-2018 the PDFs shape remained similar. 4.1.2 Bank erosion and bed topography Bends in the Ichilo River are characterized by stable vertical cutbanks constituted of a mixture of cohesive material and fine sand.

Upstream the confluence of the Ichilo River with the Sajta River the floodplain is covered by a dense forest Figure 13a . The inner part of the bends is mainly constituted of fine sand where the vegetation is composed of small bushes. The struc- ture of the points bar is presented in Figures 13c and d. Excavations made in situ showed two layers of material deposited and clearly sepa- rated by a small layer of finer material. Two sediment samples were taken in the Ichilo River with the following mean grain size D50: 0.106 mm sample 1 and 0.210 mm sample 2 . The location where the samples were taken is presented in Figure 14. Furthermore Figure 14 shows the measurements of the bed topography with the MBES and the orthophotos collected during the second field survey. Both measurements are in good agreement. In Figure 15 the data from the UAVs and the MBES bathymetry were combined in order to obtain cross-sectional profiles of the banks of the Ichilo River show- ing high consistency between the results of the UAVs and the sonar. Some areas could not be surveyed because the boat could not reach these locations due to shallow water and the presence of vegetation that obstructed access. The maximum water depth retrieved during the measurements was around 14 m near the area of the port. Another point of interest was located downstream of the confluence where the difference in riverbed elevation of the Ichilo and Sajta riv- ers was around 10 m Figures 14 and 15 section C-C0 . Bank failures were observed all along the Ichilo riverbanks Figure 15 . In general mass failures are concentrated in areas where the hydrodynamic conditions and topographic and geotechnical prop- erties of the banks induce mass failures Motta et al. 2014 particu- larly in the bend apex where outer banks with cohesive materials are steeper and taller such as in the case of the Ichilo River. There are different factors that influence the shear stress distri- bution on banks in meandering bends such as secondary flow strength bank slope width-to-depth ratio difference in roughness between bed and planform evolution Motta et al. 2014 . Flow in a cross-sectional bend is directed from the inner bank bar towards the outer bank pools due to the topography of the riverbed. Whenever this effect is strong the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs towards the outer bank leading to bank retreat due to continued action of erosion of the bank. The eroded material depending on the size and discharge of the river can remain in front of the bank as observed in some cross-sections of the Ichilo River. If the deformation is prominent the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs over the pools close to the banks. Direct action of the flow on the bank in these regions leads to bank retreat trough continuous erosion of the bank Ferreira da Silva Ebrahimi 2017 . In the Ichilo River bed ero- sion in the outer bank downstream of the channel apex of bend F1 Figure 14d indicates a full development of secondary flow. In addition changes in the bed profile of the river can be better appreciated in Figure 15 where two deep holes were observed one corresponding to the location of the confluence and the other corresponding to the area of the port. The slope of the river calculated from the profile in Figure 15 was S 0.00022. 5 DISCUSSION This research highlights the need for field works combined with spa- tiotemporal satellite imagery analysis to study the planform dynamics of small meandering rivers such as the Ichilo. The results from the sat- ellite imagery allowed us to identify the neck cutoffs as main controls on the planform evolution of the Ichilo River. In addition the analysis of two bends of the Ichilo River F1 and F2 has shown the spatial variability of the migration rates and the interaction between bends under similar hydraulic conditions. Further changes in the planform shape of these bends of the Ichilo River are likely to happen in the short term. We expect the development of cutoff F1 for several rea- sons. First the distance across the neck in F1 has been decreasing at a higher rate than in F2 due to the growth of the point bar which narrows the channel and increases the velocity of the flow towards the outer bank bar push theory van de Lageweg et al. 2014 . The satellite imagery showed that the point bar in F1 is bigger than the point bar in F2. In addition in the case of F1 the neck is experienc- ing erosion from both sides due to the skewness of the bend and the F I G U R E 1 3 Typical banks observed along the Ichilo River: a dense forest over cohesive material b banks with small bushes c d stratigraphy in a point bar of Ichilo River Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ARNEZ FERREL ET AL. 723 10969837 2021 4 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.5058 Wiley Online Library on 31/03/2025 .

The bathymetric data confirm this information where in the case of F1 the erosion is observed along both sides of the neck while in the case of F2 the erosion concentrates downstream of the neck. As the distance across the neck decreases intra-meandering flow inside the banks may increase from one bank and that could accelerate the process. Planform evolution depends on the magnitude and duration of the high and low flow discharges Asahi et al. 2013 . In the Ichilo River we observed high variability in water levels. It is expected that the river behaves differently during increasing and decreasing of the discharge affecting the accretion and erosion processes. High and lower flows seem to govern bank accretion where vertical accretion occurs during floods and transverse point bar accretion during the fail- ing stage and normal flows Crosato 2008 . Also heavy precipitation may trigger mass failures along the banks due to positive pore pres- sures that reduce the effective friction angle in the banks Thorne 1991 . During our field works we observed mass failures along the banks which corresponded to a low flow state. In our study annual migration rates showed a correlation with higher water levels in the river. A similar effect was observed by Schwenk et al. 2017 in his analysis of the Ucayali River and by Gautier et al. 2010 in the F I G U R E 1 4 Bathymetry obtained with the MBES and orthophotos taken with the UAV in May 2019. a Area of study and location of the GCPs and soil samples b-e zoom at different parts of the Ichilo River see location of the field surveys in Figure 1 Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com 724 ARNEZ FERREL ET AL. 10969837 2021 4 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.5058 Wiley Online Library on 31/03/2025 .

The higher annual migration rates in the year 2008 coin- cided with La Niña years which affected Bolivia with extreme precipi- tation events. The city of Puerto Villarroel suffered inundations from the Ichilo River that lasted 5 days. As inundation periods in the Ichilo River are usually shorter a large period of inundation may have affected the strength in the banks triggering bank failures along the river. In addition another much larger high-precipitation event was observed in 2014 where the river remained inundated for 23 days and in the following years two cutoffs were observed. Human- induced cutoffs observed in the Ichilo and Sajta rivers illustrate the impact of human intervention in the planform development of the Ichilo River. The case of cutoff 9 the human-induced cutoff as a response to a natural neck cutoff that threatened the safety of the port infrastructure consisted in the design of a new alignment for the Ichilo River and its tributary Peters 2009 . This design considered a mild curvature at the confluence of the Sajta and Ichilo rivers in order to avoid the generation of secondary flows that would promote bank erosion in Ichilo riverbanks Peters 2009 and the cutoff in the Ichilo River. If the natural meander cutoff had developed the port would have been left in the abandoned path oxbow lake eventually becom- ing useless Peters 1998 and the current planform shape of the Ichilo River would have changed to a different configuration. In addition areas where the river is stable and has not migrated in the period of our investigation were identified. The inactivity of these areas may be related to the planform spatial variability due to geologi- cal reasons Peters 1998 . For example the area between the port and the intersection with the Sajta River has maintained the original planform shape since 1988 with minor modifications even though the PET showed that the bank material is highly erodible and according to Peters 1998 this may be the reason why the inhabitants in earlier times decided on that location to establish the port. However even though only minor planform changes were observed in this area the high-resolution bathymetric data showed scour holes in the bed topography in the area near the port and near the confluence with the Sajta River. The collapse of the platform of the port at the location of the scour hole in September 2019 showed that the bed topography is also changing. The confluence with the Sajta River affects the river- bed morphology as shown by the formation of the scour hole down- stream of the confluence and deposition of this material downstream in section B-B0 Figure 14b . In addition the growth of the city along the Ichilo riverbanks has brought modification to the natural state of the river. In order to pro- tect the city against bank erosion some protection works have been implemented on the banks. These works may have constrained the position and direction of the channel axis in the right bank of the Ichilo River. Furthermore the location of the protection works coin- cides with the area where riverbed erosion is observed as illustrated in Figures 14 and 15.

Through spatiotemporal remote sensing analysis and field works we aimed to understand the factors that control the plan- form evolution of the Ichilo River. Our results showed cutoffs as the main mechanism of planform change of the Ichilo River together with human interventions. The maximum annual water level showed a small to moderate correlation with the meander migration rates. Also heavy rainfalls observed in the Ichilo River seem to correlate with the occurrence of cutoffs increases in the river width and meander migra- tion rates. A spatiotemporal analysis of the width variation has shown that a PDF distribution can describe the river width variation in the Ichilo River. A GEV probability distribution provided the best fit of data for the period from 1988 to 2013 while for the period from 2014 to 2018 an inverse Gaussian distribution showed a better fit. The PDFs presented a similar shape in years with no cutoff but years with cutoff showed changes in the PDFs. This study highlights the potential of Sf M analysis combined with MBES bathymetric surveys to obtain data in areas of remote access showing us the riverbed and bank changes in great detail. In addition to the aforementioned fac- tors we want to mention the possibility that the increased rate of for- est loss in the last 30 years in the south and southwest area of the Ichilo and Sajta rivers has affected the meander migration rates in the last years of the studied period post-2005 . The spatial variability of meander migration rates was discussed by identifying two points sus- ceptible to cutoffs near the city of Puerto Villarroel. We expect that cutoff F1 may have developed first. Future cutoff development will present further modifications to the ever-changing landscape of the Ichilo River floodplains. A new cutoff would imply morphological adjustments such as changes in the riverbed topography due to the sudden reduction of the river length. A redistribution of sediments after the event is expected with an increase in migration rates downstream. The collapse of the platform of the port located in Puerto Villarroel showed the need for bathymetric data and monitoring of the river. The lack of data on small rivers located in the upper Amazon basin such as the Ichilo calls for more field studies in order to guaran- tee the safety of the riverine communities that rely on them.

The fruit fly Drosophila is a classic model organism to study adaptation as well as the relationship between genetic variation and phenotypes. Although associated bacterial communities might be important for many aspects of Drosophila biology knowledge about their diversity composition and factors shaping them is limited. We used 454-based sequencing of a variable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize the bacterial communities associated with wild and laboratory Drosophila isolates. In order to specifically investigate effects of food source and host species on bacterial communities we analyzed samples from wild Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans collected from a variety of natural substrates as well as from adults and larvae of nine laboratory-reared Drosophila species. We find no evidence for host species effects in lab-reared flies instead lab of origin and stochastic effects which could influence studies of Drosophila phenotypes are pronounced. In contrast the natural Drosophila -associated microbiota appears to be predominantly shaped by food substrate with an additional but smaller effect of host species identity. We identify a core member of this natural microbiota that belongs to the genus Gluconobacter and is common to all wild-caught flies in this study but absent from the laboratory. This makes it a strong candidate for being part of what could be a natural D. melanogaster and D. simulans core microbiome. Furthermore we were able to identify candidate pathogens in natural fly isolates. This work was funded by a DFG Forschungsstipedium to FS STA 1154/1-1 .

Introduction Bacterial symbionts play important roles for metazoans covering the whole spectrum from beneficial mutualists to infectious disease-causing pathogens. Benefits that hosts derive from mutualists are diverse and include extracting essential nutrients from food in humans 1 breaking down cellulose in Ruminantia 2 and light production by Vibrio fisheri in the light organs of the bobtail squid 3 . In arthropods indigenous bacteria protect aphids from parasitoid wasps 4 protect beewolf larvae from infectious disease 5 and keep leaf tissue of fallen leaves photosynthetically active providing larvae of leaf-miner moths with nutrients 6 . Detrimental effects microbes have on their hosts range from lethal disease 7 to changing the sex ratio of the offspring in their favor 8 . Pathogens as well as mutualists not only interact with their hosts but at the same time with other members of the often diverse host associated microbial community 9 . Indirect evidence for competition for ecological niches in the host comes from Staubach et al. 10 who found that the lack of the glycosyltransferase B4galnt2 in mice leads to the replacement of bacterial taxa by closely related taxa. Bakula 11 showed that Escherichia coli persists in Drosophila only when monoxenic and is quickly replaced by other bacteria upon exposure suggesting that there is competition between bacteria to colonize the fly. Ryu et al. 12 demonstrated that suppressing the caudal gene by RNAi in Drosophila leads to replacement of an Acetobacter species by a Gluconobacter species followed by strong pathological consequences. These examples indicate that there is interaction and competition for ecological niches along the continuum of hosts and microbes. Thus a thorough understanding of host-microbe interactions also requires comprehensive knowledge of host associated bacterial communities and the factors shaping them. These factors can roughly be grouped into two categories. The first category includes biotic and abiotic environmental factors the host and its associated microbes are exposed to e.g. diet . The second category includes factors that are determined by host genetics. The relative importance of these factors in shaping human associated microbial communities is a matter of recent debate 13 14 . One approach to disentangle these effects is by studying the relationship of host genetic divergence diet and divergence of microbial communities. A correlation of genetic divergence between a set of host taxa and the divergence of their associated microbial communities would suggest that genetic effects play a role in shaping these communities. On the other hand a correlation of microbial community composition with diet would suggest an effect of environmental factors. This approach has been applied to a variety of mammals 15 - 17 but it has proven difficult in mammals to control for diet and other environmental factors across host taxa. Hence it is not yet clear which factors are the strongest determinants of microbiota composition. In contrast to the complex microbial communities associated with mammals like humans and mice which are estimated to consist of hundreds or even thousands of taxa 10 18 some studies suggest that only a handful of bacterial species dominate the microbial communities of invertebrates 19 20 . This has turned a spotlight on Drosophila to serve as a simpler model for understanding the complex interactions of hosts and their associated microbes 20 - 22 . The Drosophila immune system is reasonably well understood 23 and the tractability of Drosophila has helped to identify genes involved in specific interactions between host and microbes. This includes genes underlying avoidance behavior towards harmful bacteria 24 and immune defense 25 as well as interactions with commensals 26 and beneficial bacteria that prevent pathogens from colonizing the host 12 or promote its growth 27 28 . As a first step in understanding the diversity of bacterial communities associated with Drosophila it is important to investigate flies under natural conditions. Most studies conducted to date focused on more specific interactions or those found in the lab 20 29 while few studies described the natural diversity of fly associated bacterial communities. Cox and Gilmore 30 included natural fly isolates and combined culture and culture-independent methods to characterize fly associated microbial communities. Corby-Harris et al. 31 focused their study on the diversity of microbial communities along latitudinal clines. Chandler et al. 32 conducted the most comprehensive analysis of bacteria associated with Drosophila by sampling a range of drosophilid flies from their natural food substrates. However these studies were limited by either throughput or dependence on cultivation 33 . Although Chandler et al. 32 sampled flies from different natural substrates their sampling scheme did not allow to directly disentangle host species and diet effects on the natural microbiota because this requires replicated pairwise sampling of at least two host species from the identical substrate. In order to understand bacterial communities associated with Drosophila and the factors shaping their diversity we investigated the relative effects of food substrate and fly species. Accordingly we analyzed D. melanogaster and D. simulans collected in pairs from different natural food sources as well as under controlled lab conditions. Furthermore we assessed the communities of nine lab-reared Drosophila species and their larvae to evaluate the influence of host genetic background on a broad scale. These species were selected to span the Drosophila genus and match the 12 species sequenced by Clark et al. 34 D. melanogaster D. simulans D. sechellia D. yakuba D. erecta D. pseudoobscura D. persimilis D. virilis D. mojavensis . Results In order to profile Drosophila -associated bacterial communities we amplified and sequenced 300 bp base pairs of the 16S r RNA gene see Materials and Methods spanning the variable regions V1 and V2. Three types of fly isolates were used in our study. The samples are listed in Table 1 . First species-pairs of wild-caught D. melanogaster and D. simulans samples were collected from different substrates oranges strawberries apples peaches compost at multiple locations on the East and West Coast of the USA. Within each sample pair D. melanogaster and D. simulans individuals were collected at the same location time and substrate mostly by aspiration of individual flies from the same fruit thereby controlling for environmental variables to the extent possible in the field. This allowed us to study the effects of both substrate and host species on the composition of bacterial communities independently of each other. Second we included isofemale wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans that were reared in the Petrov lab for 3 years after collection. Third a variety of Drosophila species from the UCSD Stock Center was chosen to complement the analysis. We primarily focused on adults but also studied bacterial communities in larvae of the lab-reared strains. We analyzed a total of 340 000 sequences that matched our quality criteria see Materials and Methods . 130 000 sequences matched the Wolbachia 16S r RNA gene and were excluded from the analysis. For Petrov lab D. simulans sample 6 removal of Wolbachia sequences led to a very low number of remaining sequences 18 sequences .

Diversity of bacterial communities associated with Drosophila For assessing the Drosophila associated bacterial diversity in general we grouped all sequences into 97 identity operational taxonomic units OTUs and calculated inverted Simpson diversity indices 35 . Rarefaction curves are plotted in Figure 1 . Bacterial communities associated with lab-reared flies are strikingly less diverse than those of wild-caught flies P 2.9 10 -5 Wilcoxon test on Simpson diversity index indicating a bias towards a few dominant species in the lab compared to more complex and species-rich communities of wild-caught flies. However substantial variance of community diversity was found between individual samples from lab-reared flies. While bacterial diversity in 14 out of 20 lab-reared fly samples is lower than in all wild-caught samples the diversity of lab-reared D. erecta D. persimilis D. sechellia D. virilis and Petrov lab D. melanogaster sample 3 m.pet3 in Table 1 lies within the range of wild-caught samples. The diversity observed in Petrov lab D. melanogaster sample 6 m.pet6 is even higher than in wild-caught flies and its community composition appears to differ from the other Petrov lab samples Figure 2C . Because this sample was unusual we conducted all of the subsequent analyses with and without this sample but did not notice any qualitative differences data not shown . All of the analyses described below that include lab-reared samples also include this sample. 10.1371/journal.pone.0070749.g001 Figure 1 Rarefaction curves of 97 identity OTUs A for adult male flies. 10.1371/journal.pone.0070749.g002 Figure 2 Relative abundance of bacterial taxa as assessed by 16S r RNA gene sequences.

Comparing estimates of species richness and diversity from our study to estimates from lab-reared flies in Wong et al. 20 supports the notion that bacterial communities of lab-reared flies are less species rich Table 2 . Our species richness estimates from wild-caught flies are more than twice as high on average 43 vs 19 P 0.001 if we exclude all OTUs that contain fewer than 10 sequences from our data as in Wong et al. 20 . Bacterial diversity as measured by Shannon s diversity index is also significantly higher in wild-caught flies P 0.01 from this study. We also compared the bacterial community diversity in this study to that observed in previous studies of wild-caught Drosophila bacterial communities namely Corby-Harris et al. 31 Cox and Gilmore 30 and Chandler et al . 32 . A comparison of diversity indices among studies is provided in Table 2 . Estimated species-richness is more than seven times higher in our study compared to all other studies P 0.001 Student s T-test . However limiting our data artificially to 100 sequences per sample which is well within the range of the sequencing depth of the above studies results in an average Chao s richness estimate of 22 species. This is not significantly different from the richness estimates of the other studies on wild-caught flies implying that different sequencing depths are responsible for the different species richness estimates. When we limit our sample size to 100 sequences to make our study more comparable to the clone library data from Cox and Gilmore 30 and Chandler et al. 32 we find values for Shannon s diversity index that are similar and even a bit higher P 0.001 Student s T-test in these two studies.

P-values are relative to wild-caught flies in this study. Values and p-values in parentheses are for subsampling our samples to 100 16S r RNA gene sequences per sample to make the results comparable to other studies on wild-caught Drosophila . Values in square brackets are for removing all OTUs that contain fewer than 10 sequences from the analysis to make our study more comparable to Wong et al. 20 . Bacterial community composition In order to examine which bacterial taxa are associated with Drosophila we classified the 16S r RNA gene sequences by aligning them to the SILVA reference database 36 using MOTHUR 37 . The results are summarized in Figure 2 . Our results show that on the family level the combined communities are dominated by Acetobacteraceae 55.3 and Lactobacillaceae 31.7 Figure 2A . Leuconostocaceae 3.8 Enterobacteriaceae 3.3 and Enterococcaceae 1.9 are less abundant. All five of these families are known to be associated with Drosophila 6 32 including certain Drosophila pathogenic Enterococcus strains. The remaining sequences 3.9 are low abundance families mainly belonging to the Proteobacteria. In addition to the differences in overall diversity described above different bacterial genera dominate the communities of lab-reared and wild-caught flies Figure 2B . The dominant genera also vary sharply between flies from the Petrov lab and the UCSD Stock Center. Specifically communities associated with wild-caught flies are dominated by Gluconobacter 39.3 average relative abundance Acetobacter 25.5 and an enteric bacteria cluster 10.4 that is mainly comprised of Pectobacterium 4.8 of total average relative abundance Serratia 3.5 Erwinia 1.3 and Brenneria 0.5 . In contrast Gluconobacter and the enteric bacteria cluster are virtually absent from our lab-reared flies 0.001 and 0.1 . Acetobacter is extremely common in UCSD Stock Center lab-reared flies 72.7 but comprises only 1.2 of the bacterial communities in flies from the Petrov lab. On the other hand Lactobacillus contributes a substantial fraction of sequences in lab-reared flies 60.4 in Petrov lab 19.1 UCSD Stock Center while playing only a minor role in wild-caught flies 0.5 . In addition Leuconostoc is common in the Petrov lab 28.0 but rare 1 in wild-caught flies and the UCSD Stock Center 1 . Inspection of individual samples revealed that the relative abundance of Leuconostoc is highly variable across D. melanogaster and D. simulans . In Petrov lab flies relative abundance ranges from 87.6 and 84.5 in samples m.pet1 and s.pet1 respectively to being undetectable in m.pet4 m.pet5 s.pet2 and s.pet5 Figure 2C . In addition to differences in broad patterns of community composition we also detected two wild-caught samples dominated by genera that are rare overall: 80.3 of all sequences in the D. melanogaster sample m.ora1 collected from oranges were classified as Enterococcus 80.3 while the sample m.str collected from strawberries has a high prevalence of Providencia 26.3 . The relative abundance of Enterococcus is smaller than 0.5 in all other wild-caught samples. Providencia was detected in only three other samples at a relative abundance smaller than or equal to 1 . Intriguingly 92 1165 sequences of all Providencia sequences from sample m.str are identical suggesting the presence of a single high-frequency Providencia strain in m.str. The highly prevalent sequence from sample m.str is 100 identical to the sequence of P. alcalifaciens from Juneja and Lazzaro 38 while it differs from all other Providencia sequences in 38 by at least two positions Figure 3A . P. alcalifaciens was shown to be highly virulent in D. melanogaster 7 causing the highest mortality amongst all strains tested and reaching cell counts of up to 10 6 colony forming units per fly. 10.1371/journal.pone.0070749.g003 Figure 3 A Segregating sites of the 16S r RNA gene alignment of the highly abundant Providencia sequence from D. melanogaster grey background collected from strawberries m.str to Providencia species from 38 . Sequences are sorted by virulence as determined by 7 . Note that Galac and Lazzaro determined virulence of a different but closely related P. alcalifaciens strain. B Heatmap of the 10 most abundant 97 identity OTUs across all samples. OTUs are sorted by average relative abundance across all samples from left to right with the most abundant OTU to the left. Grey shades indicate the relative abundance of each OTU for a given sample. Numbers in brackets are OTU identifiers. By grouping all sequences into 97 identity OTUs we sought to obtain a more detailed picture of bacterial community composition. Figure 3B depicts the relative abundance of the ten most abundant OTUs across all samples. A single OTU classified as Gluconobacter is common among all wild-caught flies 34.7 average relative abundance OTU 25 but completely absent from lab-reared flies. Even in the wild-caught fly sample m.ora1 that is dominated by an Enterococcus OTU OTU 60 this Gluconobacter OTU represents 8.9 of all non- Enterococcus sequences. Because this OTU is common in all wild-caught flies and specific to wild-caught flies it is a strong candidate for being a member of a D. melanogaster and D. simulans core microbiome in nature. Three Acetobacter OTUs are also common in wild-caught flies OTUs 26 23 and 29 . However these OTUs are rare in flies collected from oranges and OTU 26 is also prevalent in lab-reared flies from the UCSD Stock Center. In lab-reared flies especially flies from the Petrov lab three Lactobacillus OTUs are common OTU 28 22 and 35 . The abundance of these OTUs is highly variable between samples with one dominant OTU OTU 28 that is common in most Petrov lab samples while the other two OTUs are at high frequency in the larval samples mpet1_l OTU 22 and m.pet6_l OTU 35 . The second most common Acetobacter OTU OTU 38 is common only in the UCSD Stock Center samples and larval sample s.pet3_l. In UCSD samples this OTU is strongly negatively correlated with OTU 26 P 2.9 10 -5 r 2 0.64 which was also classified as Acetobacter . The composition of bacterial communities associated with flies differ between laboratories and the wild In order to further explore the factors shaping the observed variation in bacterial communities between lab-reared and wild-caught flies we carried out a Principal Coordinate Analysis PCo A using pairwise Jaccard distances. Jaccard distances compare the number of OTUs that are shared between two communities to the total number in both communities with a smaller proportion of shared OTUs leading to an increased Jaccard distance. Jaccard distance analysis requires that the same number of sequences is used in each sample. This is because samples that contain more sequences are more likely to include low frequency OTUs that can appear private to that sample and inflate Jaccard distances. We therefore in silico capped the number of sequence reads per sample to a common number by subsampling. In order to test for potential stochastic effects of subsampling on our results we analyzed 1000 bootstraps of the subsampling for all PCo As presented. Figure 4A shows the position of all samples analyzed in this study relative to the first two PCos. PCo1 explains 16.1 of the variation and separates wild-caught Petrov lab and UCSD Stock Center communities from each other P 5.4 10 -15 and r 2 0.79 ANOVA 100 of bootstraps P 1.9 10 -11 . PCo2 explains 9.9 of the variation and separates wild-caught from lab-reared flies P 2 10 -16 and r 2 0.87 ANOVA 100 of bootstraps P 9.3 10 -13 . These results suggest that Petrov lab UCSD Stock Center and wild-caught flies all have their own distinct bacterial communities. 10.1371/journal.pone.0070749.g004 Figure 4 PCo A of Jaccard distances based on 97 identity OTUs. A All samples in this study. Colors are according to origin. B Wild-caught samples. Colors are according to food-substrate C Wild-caught samples PCo3. D. melanogaster and D. simulans differ significantly for PCo3 P 0.0011 . Colors are according to food-substrate. Similarity between larval and adult samples from the same laboratory further underscores the importance of the origin of the flies Petrov lab UCSD Stock Center for the composition of their associated microbiota. The only exception is Petrov lab D. simulans larval sample 3 s.pet3_l which grouped closer to the UCSD samples in Figure 4A and has a more UCSD-like community dominated by Acetobacter Figure 2C . Communities of wild-caught flies differ by substrate and between D. melanogaster and D. simulans We analyzed paired samples of wild-caught D. melanogaster and D. simulans isolated from five different natural substrates oranges apples peaches strawberries and compost in order to elucidate the influence of substrate on fly-associated bacterial communities in the wild. Figure 4B shows a PCo A including only wild-caught D. melanogaster and D. simulans samples. Communities of flies collected from oranges at three different sampling locations are clearly separated from the remaining samples by PCo1 P 0.00017 r 2 0.71 ANOVA 100 of bootstraps P 0.008 . PCo2 separates bacterial communities from the flies collected from the compost pile and those from the flies collected from the fruit substrates P 0.001 r 2 0.61 ANOVA 98.1 of bootstraps P 0.05 indicating that food substrate or a variable correlated with food substrate is an important factor shaping fly-associated bacterial communities. Interestingly communities of flies from strawberries apples and peaches are relatively similar irrespective of sampling location. Flies from strawberries were collected from a sampling location on the West coast of the US while flies from apples and peaches were collected on the East Coast of the US. While the first two PCos in the PCo A of wild-caught flies Figure 4B reflect differences related to food substrate PCo3 PCo4 and PCo5 reveal a more subtle but significant difference between the communities associated with the two fly species. In 78 of all subsampling bootstraps we found a significant difference ANOVA P 0.05 between D. melanogaster and D. simulans associated microbial communities along these PCos Figure S1 . This represents a significant enrichment of low p-values P 4.9 10 -149 Chi-squared test . An example from these bootstraps in which PCo3 differentiates between D. melanogaster and D. simulans is given in Figure 4C P 0.0011 r 2 0.60 ANOVA . We do not detect such a difference between lab-reared D. melanogaster and D. simulans data not shown . Discussion In this study we focused primarily on understanding the factors that shape Drosophila -associated bacterial communities with an emphasis on the relative roles of environmental and host species effects. In order to disentangle environmental from host species effects we collected and compared sample pairs of D. melanogaster and D. simulans from the same natural substrates. We extended this approach by analyzing these two species under controlled laboratory conditions. Finally in order to generalize our results we also analyzed a set of host species spanning the Drosophila phylogeny. A correlation between genetic distance of different fly species and the dissimilarity of their bacterial communities under controlled conditions would be an indication that genetic differences between host species could play a role in shaping fly bacterial communities. Therefore we extracted bacterial DNA from whole flies by carrying out extensive tissue homogenization. The bacterial load on the fly surface is known to be 10 times lower than the interior load 29 . Therefore the influence of external bacteria on the total community composition is expected to be rather minor. Additionally our focus on the total bacteria associated with the whole fly and not only the intestinal tract was motivated by the belief that bacteria associated with fly surfaces might play important roles in shaping the fly environment. This is supported by Ren et al . 29 who found acetic acid bacteria accumulating in bristled areas on the fly surface likely forming biofilms and by Barata et al . 33 who demonstrated that damaged grapes do not acquire acetic acid bacteria when insects particularly Drosophila are physically excluded. These acetic acid bacteria could very well be transported on the fly surface. Note that even though we aspirated flies from individual fruit and attempted to associate bacterial communities with the substrate we likely sampled bacterial communities that the fly has acquired during its life span. This includes bacteria from the particular fruit from which it was sampled but could also include bacteria potentially from prior locations. Factors shaping natural fly associated communities We determined that substrate or a strongly correlated variable is the most important factor shaping bacterial communities in wild-caught flies. Diet has been previously suggested as a major determinant of bacterial community composition in mammals 14 15 39 and flies 32 and our results agree with these findings. The most distinct bacterial communities were associated with flies collected from oranges. Oranges contain citric acid and might have a lower p H than other substrates. Furthermore orange peel contains essential oils that have bactericidal properties that might influence the bacterial community composition 40 . Although the substrate appears to be a plausible factor shaping the communities here we cannot disentangle its effects from seasonal effects e.g. temperature humidity . This is because we collected flies from different substrates at different times of the year when the respective fruit were ripe. We carefully sampled D. melanogaster and D. simulans across different sites and substrates in nature which allowed us to disentangle environmental effects from host species effects on microbial community composition. We found evidence that host fly species identity D. melanogaster vs. D. simulans detectably influences the associated microbial communities but that the effect is subtle. Although our power comparing lab-reared D. melanogaster and D. simulans might be lower because of smaller sample size and restriction to fewer sequences mainly due to high Wolbachia prevalence in some lab-reared samples it is intriguing that this host species effect is detectable only in the wild and could not be detected in lab-reared flies. Moreover while we detected differences between two closely related sister species in the wild we could not detect any differences for nine substantially more divergent Drosophila species in the lab. We found no correspondence of distances between bacterial communities and genetic distances between nine lab-reared fly species Table S2 unlike Ochman et al. 16 and Ley et al. 15 who found this correlation in primates and other mammals. Taken together these findings imply that the effects of host species on microbial communities are rather subtle in drosophilids and/or need natural environmental conditions to manifest themselves. The observed difference between D. melanogaster and D. simulans microbial communities might be caused by a variety of host-associated factors such as arrival times at fruit 41 42 age distributions in the wild Emily Behrman and Paul Schmidt University of Pennsylvania personal communication or host genetic differences 12 25 43 . Composition of bacterial communities in the lab and in the wild PCo A revealed that in concordance with earlier studies 30 32 bacterial communities associated with Drosophila differ sharply between different laboratories and between laboratories and the wild. Interestingly bacteria from different genera but with similar metabolic properties dominate the communities of wild-caught Petrov lab and UCSD Stock Center flies. Gluconobacter species are the most prevalent bacteria in wild-caught flies in our study. This is in accordance with Corby-Harris et al . 31 who also find abundant Gluconobacter sequences in wild-caught flies but different from Chandler et al. 32 who find a smaller fraction of Gluconobacter sequences. More than 90 of all Gluconobacter sequences in our study can be grouped into a single OTU that is common in all wild-caught flies. In contrast Gluconobacter is almost absent from the lab strains. Thus this OTU is a strong candidate for being a major member of a core microbiome that is shared among and specific to wild-caught D. melanogaster and D. simulans . Gluconobacter belongs to the same family Acetobacteraceae as Acetobacter which is also common in wild-caught flies with the exception of flies from oranges that carry less Acetobacter. Acetobacter is also the most prevalent genus in flies from the UCSD Stock Center and has very similar metabolic capabilities. Both genera Gluconobacter and Acetobacter oxidize sugars and alcohol to acetic acid and tolerate low p H as well as high ethanol concentrations 44 . Acetic acid bacteria have been reported to occur in association with many insect species and a role as important symbionts has been postulated by Crotti et al. 45 . Lactobacillus which is at high prevalence in Petrov lab flies tolerates low p H and high ethanol concentrations as well but instead oxidize sugars to lactic acid 46 . The high prevalence of bacteria with similar metabolic capabilities tolerance of low p H and high ethanol concentrations strongly suggests that there is environmental selection for these bacterial groups. Rotting fruit the most important natural substrate for D. melanogaster and D. simulans in our study contain high amounts of sugar and are known to be colonized by a variety of ethanol producing yeasts 47 . Yeasts can produce high alcohol concentrations thereby generating a nutrient rich environment for acetic acid or lactic acid producing bacteria Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae while inhibiting the growth of those less tolerant to alcohol. The production of these acids selects for acid tolerant microorganisms including the microorganisms that produced the acids in the first place. This suggests that environmental selection 48 is an important factor for the observed prevalence of these bacteria. Interestingly bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus which have been associated with effects on Drosophila growth 28 and even assortative mating 49 are prevalent only in the lab in our study. Sixty percent of all sequences from Petrov lab flies and 19 of all sequences obtained from UCSD Stock Center flies are Lactobacillus . In most wild-caught samples Lactobacillus represented less than 1 of all sequences. This finding is corroborated by results from Chandler et al . 32 who find an increase of the proportion of Lactobacillus species in lab-reared flies. Thus while studying the effects of Lactobacillus on drosophilids in the laboratory is useful as a general model for insect-microbe interactions its relevance to Drosophila in nature may be limited. In contrast to Chandler et al. 32 who found that Enterobacteriaceae from group Orbus are highly prevalent in Drosophila these bacteria are absent or at very low frequency in our samples not amongst the best BLAST hits for any of the 100 most abundant OTUs in our data set . Although two lower abundant OTUs OTU 49 and OTU 221 have Orbus sequences among the top 50 BLAST hits the sequences from 32 are not amongst these hits. We can only speculate about the reasons for this difference here. One possibility might be an epidemic of Orbus group bacteria in 2007 and 2008 when Chandler et al. 32 collected their samples. Given the strong effect of food substrates that we observed in wild Drosophila similar effects might play a role in lab-reared flies. Differences in the provided food substrates between laboratories might therefore lead to differences in communities. For example we provide our flies with a corn meal molasses diet whereas the Stock Center uses sugar instead of molasses. In addition our food contains Tegosept r to reduce microbial growth while this ingredient is only optional at UCSD. Intriguingly Chandler et al . 32 found that fly-associated bacterial communities differed between labs at UC Davis despite using the same food from the same kitchen suggesting that other factors are involved as well. Candidate explanations would involve ecological drift which is likely to be stronger in the laboratory and priority effects 42 50 51 . A potential role of stochastic drift processes and priority effects is supported by the notion that the occurrence of the two major Acetobacter OTUs OTU 26 and 38 in the UCSD Stock Center flies is strongly antagonistic. This is in accordance with a model in which one of the OTUs quickly occupies an ecological niche and excludes its ecologically similar close relative. Bacterial communities of lab-reared flies are highly variable in diversity and composition within and between laboratories in this study. Because fly phenotypes are influenced by bacteria 27 28 52 this bacterial variation can add to the variance of phenotypic traits. This makes it more difficult to detect genetic variation underlying phenotypic traits and reduces reproducibility between laboratories. The presence of a certain microbiota might also lead to unwanted results in genetic trait mapping: Genetic variation that is attributed to directly underlie a phenotypic trait might indeed interact with microbes that influence this trait instead thus influencing the trait only indirectly. Monitoring of microbial communities during experiments in which phenotypes are measured could be a means to approach these difficulties. Species richness of lab-reared and wild-caught Drosophila associated bacterial communities Although diversity varies strongly across different samples from lab-reared flies their bacterial communities are on average less diverse than those of wild-caught flies. This has been reported previously 30 32 53 . The three most plausible explanations for this pattern in our study are: i laboratory fly food is highly homogeneous and contains antimicrobial preservatives proprionic acid and Tegosept r in our case which inhibit bacterial growth and likely reduce bacterial diversity ii the transfer of flies to vials with fresh food during stock keeping could lead to ecological drift 50 which reduces diversity in the long run due to potential loss of taxa iii while there is a constant influx of new bacteria into natural fly habitats e.g. from other insects or via aerial transport this influx is limited by cotton-sealed vials used in Drosophila husbandry. It is known that species richness is often overestimated using pyrosequencing approaches e.g. 54 . We applied rigorous quality filtering and Chimera detection see Materials and Methods and used an OTU threshold of 97 identity which is thought to be robust against sequencing and PCR errors 54 . Although we take all these measures we can not exclude that we are still overestimating the diversity in our samples. On the other hand overly stringent removal of sequences might make us miss important aspects of microbial communities 55 . Potential fly pathogens The bacterial communities of certain wild-caught fly isolates contained potential Drosophila pathogens at high frequencies. In one sample of D. melanogaster from strawberries more than 25 of all sequences were identical to those of P. alcalifaciens whereas Providencia is absent or at very low frequency in all other samples. This bacterium is known to be highly virulent in fruit flies 7 but reaches high bacterial loads in flies usually only when flies are systemically infected personal communication Brian Lazzaro Cornell University . Enterococcus was present at high abundance in one D. melanogaster orange sample 1 m.ora1 80.3 but virtually absent from all other samples. Enterococcus species were previously found to be associated with D. melanogaster 32 and are highly prevalent in the lab-reared flies studied by Cox and Gilmore 30 . These authors showed that Enterococcus can reach densities of 10 5 colony forming units per fly causing severe disease symptoms and high mortality. This compares to a total of 10 4 colony forming units including all bacterial species in healthy flies 29 30 . The presence of these disease-associated genera in individual samples and their absence or near absence from other samples suggests that one or more flies were systemically infected in the samples that showed a high relative abundance of the disease associated genus. Thus detection of infections with potential pathogens in natural fly populations seems possible by bacterial 16S r RNA gene sequencing. Hence 16S r RNA sequencing could be a powerful means for the epidemiological monitoring of bacterial pathogens. Conclusion We show that under natural conditions the bacterial communities associated with Drosophila correlate mainly with the substrate the flies have been collected from and to a smaller extent with fly species. Despite appreciable effort we did not find evidence for host species effects on the bacterial communities under controlled laboratory conditions. Instead laboratory of origin and stochastic effects on microbial communities are pronounced in the laboratory. This suggests that host genetic effects as represented by genetic differences between the fly species in this study might be rather small or absent in the lab while there is potential for such effects under natural conditions. Furthermore we find that acetic acid producing bacteria Acetobacteracea are ubiquitous symbionts of Drosophila in nature. Intriguingly it has been shown both that D. melanogaster promotes dispersal and establishment of these bacteria 33 and that the presence of acetic acid bacteria can have beneficial effects on D. melanogaster larval growth and development time 27 . Together these findings suggest that D. melanogaster and its siblings transport and establish the acetic acid bacteria on the substrates which might modify these substrates in ways beneficial to the flies and their offspring. We speculate that the microbial community associated with Drosophila can be seen as an external organ of the fly holobiont 56 in a similar way that the human gut flora has been referred to as the forgotten organ 57 .

Petrov lab D. melanogaster and D. simulans were originally collected in Portland OR and San Diego CA in 2008 and lab-reared on standard molasses corn meal diet for 3 years 27 g Agar 75 g corn meal 200 ml molasses 42 g dry active yeast 40 ml Tegosept 15 ml propionic acid in 2.8 l deionized water . Note that the food is boiled for 20 minutes killing most of the microbes in the food and that Tegosept is added after cooling down to prevent excessive microbial growth. We used flies from six independently acquired isofemale lines from each fly species m.pet1-6 and s.pet 1-6 . All lines were kept under the same conditions and on the same food but in independent vials. DNA extractions and library preparations were performed independently for each line. All adult lab-reared flies were transferred to fresh Petrov lab food vials 24 hours prior to DNA extraction. Petrov lab flies were taken from culture vials in the Petrov lab and placed on fresh food 24 hours prior extraction. UCSD Stock Center flies were taken from the vials we received from the Stock Center and placed on fresh Petrov lab food 24 hours prior extraction. Wild D. melanogaster and D. simulans from rotting apples peaches and a compost pile were collected in an orchard on the East coast of the USA Johnston RI in August 2010. Flies from oranges were collected from three locations in the Central Valley of California USA: at a location close to Brentwood at a site East of Manteca and a site in Escalon in February and March 2011. Flies from strawberries were collected close to Waterford CA in May 2011. All sampling sites were at least 10 km apart from each other. In most cases pairs of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were picked from the same individual fruit. Otherwise flies were selected from the same type of fruit in close proximity. Flies were transported to the lab alive in empty vials. On hot days flies were slightly chilled using ice or car A/C. All flies were brought back to the lab within 5 hours of collection. Males of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were identified by genital morphology and stored at -80 C until DNA extraction. Flies from Johnston RI were shipped on dry ice to the Petrov lab for DNA extraction. For the collection of larval samples from lab-reared flies adult flies were transferred to fresh Petrov lab food vials for two days and then removed from the vial again. Vials containing eggs were kept at room temperature until larvae started to crawl out of the food for pupation. Larvae leaving the food and larvae of the same size that were still in the food were regarded third instar larvae and collected for DNA extraction. Excess food was removed from the larvae by transferring them to a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 μl PBS p H 7.4 vortexing for 3 seconds and then discarding the liquid. The larval samples correspond to the adult flies i.e. the sample named m.pet1_l was collected from the same isofemale line as m.pet1 using the procedure described above. DNA Extraction and PCR DNA was extracted from pools of five males with the exception of D. simulans orange sample 1 s.ora1 and D. melanogaster orange sample 3 m.ora3 for both of which we were able to retrieve three males only. Larval samples included three third instar larvae per sample. DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA extraction kit Qiagen Carlsbad CA following the manufacturer s protocol with the following modifications: Flies/larvae were incubated in buffer ATL containing proteinase K at 56 C for 30 min to soften and predigest the exoskeleton. Digestion was then interrupted by 3 minutes of bead beating on a Bio Spec Mini Bead Beater 96 with glass beads 0.1 mm 0.5 mm and 1 mm in size Bio Spec Bartlesville OK followed by another 30 min of incubation at 56 C. After addition of lysis buffer AL samples were incubated 30 min at 70 C and 10 min at 95 C. The remaining extraction procedure was performed according to the manufacturer s protocol. Extraction controls were run in parallel with all samples to monitor contamination. Broad range primers 27F and 338R were fused to identification tags and the 454 sequencing primers to amplify a fragment spanning the variable regions V1 and V2 of the bacterial ribosomal 16S r RNA gene. The primer sequences are 5 -CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTC and reverse AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG -3 5 -CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXXXXXXXXXXCA . The Xs are a placeholder for identification tags Multiplex Identifiers MIDs a different tag was used for each amplification reaction. Primers 27F and 338R are underlined. DNA was amplified using Phusion Hot Start DNA Polymerase Finnzymes Espoo Finland and the following cycling conditions: 30 sec at 98 C 35 cycles of 9 sec at 98 C 30 sec at 55 C and 30 sec at 72 C final extension for 10 min at 72 C . In order to reduce PCR bias amplification reactions were performed in duplicate and pooled. In order to reduce the number of TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT -3 Wolbachia amplicons PCR products were restriction digested with 2 μl Fast Digest Bst Z17 Fermentas Glen Burnie MD at 37 C for 30 min. Bst Z17 was selected to specifically cut Wolbachia sequences close to the middle of the amplified region. Reaction products were run on an agarose gel extracted using the Qiagen Min Elute Gel Extraction Kit and quantified with the Quant-i TTM ds DNA BR Assay Kit on a Nano Drop 3300 Fluorometer. Equimolar amounts of purified PCR product from each sample were pooled and further purified using Ampure Beads Agencourt . The pool was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to emulsion PCR for final quantification. Resulting PCR products were run on a 454 sequencer using Titanium Chemistry. A set of samples was extracted using a Fast Prep FP120 bead beater Qbiogene Carlsbad CA . These samples include D. erecta D. yakuba D. sechellia from the UCSD Stock Center and wild-caught samples collected in Johnston RI. These samples were sequenced twice with and without the Bst Z17 digest. Relative abundance of bacterial taxa correlated strongly between the two procedures for these samples after removal of Wolbachia reads mean r 2 0.94 . Therefore we pooled the sequencing reads obtained with and without the digest to get a higher sequencing depth per sample. Amplicons from samples with a high Wolbachia load were often so effectively digested that the final DNA yield was too small for library preparation. In order to have enough PCR-product for library construction we shortened digestion time for amplicons from these samples to 5 minutes resulting in an incomplete digest. Predictably these samples yielded a high percentage of Wolbachia sequences after the incomplete digest. We verified the specificity of the Bst Z17 for cutting Wolbachia sequences by an in silico search for restriction sites in our sequences from undigested samples all sequences from Chandler et al. 32 and all bacterial sequences in the SILVA data base. A very small fraction of non- Wolbachia sequences would have been cut in our sequence set from undigested samples 27 out of 23423 and the data from Chandler et al. 32 18 out of 3243 mainly confined to a single sample . The majority of these sequences were classified as Rhizobiales. In silico search for the Bst Z17 restriction site in sequences from the SILVA database revealed that the sequences that would have been cut by the restriction enzyme fall mainly into the orders of Rhizobiales Myxococcales and a non- Wolbachia Rickettsiales. Although these orders have either not been reported to be associated with Drosophila or occur only at very low numbers the pretreatment with Bst Z17 of most of our samples might have led to underestimation of their abundance in this study. Data analysis The MOTHUR v1.23.1 37 software was used for analysis. We used the trim.seqs command to remove primer and MID tags and quality filter our sequences according to the following requirements: Minimum average quality of 35 in each 50 bp window minimum length of 260 bp homopolymers no longer than 8 bp. Only sequences matching the MIDs and the bacterial primers perfectly were kept. Passing sequences were filtered for sequencing errors using the pre.cluster command. Sequences were then screened for chimeras using UCHIME 58 as implemented in MOTHUR with standard settings separately for each sample. 2 of all sequences were identified as chimeric and discarded. The remaining sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference database 36 using the MOTHUR implemented kmer algorithm with standard settings. Sequences not aligning in the expected region were removed using the screen.seqs command. Sequences were classified into bacterial taxa with the classify.seqs command using the SILVA reference database and taxonomy with default settings. Sequences classified as Wolbachia were removed from further analysis. Grouping of sequences into OTUs was done using the MOTHUR implemented average neighbor algorithm. Inverted Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were generated with the collect.single command. Rarefaction sampling was performed with the rarefaction.single command. The sequence with the smallest distance to all other sequences in each OTU was picked with the get.oturep command using the weighted option and classified with the classify.otu command using the SILVA reference database and taxonomy. Representative sequences of the 100 most common OTUs were also searched in the nr/nt database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ncbi using megablast with default settings via the web server http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ . Taxonomy information from the BLAST results was compared to the classification using the SILVA database. PCo A of Jaccard distances was performed applying the pcoa command on a Jaccard distance matrix generated with the dist.shared command. Because Jaccard distance is based on presence and absence of OTUs it is sensitive to information from low abundance OTUs even in the presence of other more abundant OTUs. In an abundance-based distance measure this information would likely be swamped by few extremely common OTUs. These considerations are particularly relevant to our study where a handful of bacterial families dominate the data Figure 2A . Jaccard distances are also less prone to be affected by biased abundance measurements that can result from amplification biases during PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S r RNA gene. The downside of the sensitivity of Jaccard distances to low abundance OTUs is that samples with a higher number of bacterial sequence reads can be biased towards detecting more low abundance OTUs which inflates Jaccard distance. Therefore the number of sequences per sample was in silico capped to have the same number of sequences per sample before calculation of Jaccard distances. The caps were 912 sequences per sample for the PCo A of wild-caught flies and 116 sequences per sample for the PCo A including all samples.
